results during fy2022, the group continued to principally engage in the business of marine transportation, investment holding, property holding and investment, and merchandise trading.
overall speaking, the market conditions of the group's marine transportation business had improved considerably during the year primarily due to the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the pandemic, amid the market uncertainties brought by the russia-ukraine war, the intermittent disruptions to the global supply chain owing to congestions of some main ports including the ones in china, and the rising inflation and interest rates resulted in slower economic growth in some major economies in the latter part of the year.
for fy2022, the group reported an increase in revenue by 27% to us$12,372,000 2021: us$9,738,000, driven by the increase in revenue of the marine transportation business, and recorded a profit attributable to owners of the company of us$1,123,000 2021: us$10,488,000.
basic earnings per share were us0.10 cent 2021: us0.96 singapore cents.
the decrease in the group's profit was mainly attributed to the recognition of impairment loss on vessels of us$797,000 2021: reversal of impairment loss of us$13,430,000, though partly offset by i the increase in profit contribution from the group's marine transportation operation to us$5,436,000 2021: us$3,938,000; and ii the decrease in net allowance for credit losses on debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income to us$1,402,000 2021: us$5,360,000.
prospects with the full relaxation of anti-covid measures in many countries and global trading activities are returning to their normality, the group is prudently optimistic about the prospects of the marine transportation business in the medium to long term, amidst the russia-ukraine war and the fast rising inflation and interest rates in some major economies including the us are bringing uncertainties to the market.
the group has yet to acquire a second-hand supramax vessel as the price of this vessel class has increased significantly since 2021, however, there are signs recently that the second-hand dry bulk vessel market is softening compared to its peak in around mid-2022 and some buying opportunities have emerged.
looking forward, the group will continue with its plan of acquiring a second-hand dry bulk vessel, and may include the panamax size carrier with greater carrying capacity i.e.
about 75,000 dead weight tonnage than supramax as its target vessel type, which will allow more options to the group.
the group will inform shareholders of any update of the vessel acquisition as and when appropriate.
moreover, the group will continue to manage its businesses in a disciplined manner, as well as to explore potential investment and acquisition opportunities and business enhancement strategies which are expected to bring long-term benefits to the group.
. 4 chairman's statement appreciation i would like to express my sincere thanks to all our shareholders, investors, bankers, business associates and customers for their continuing support to the group, my fellow directors for their valuable services, and all staff members for their dedicated efforts during fy2022.
sue ka lok chairman hong kong, 24 march 2023 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 5 management discussion and analysis business review during the year ended 31 december 2022 “fy2022”, the group continued to principally engage in the business of marine transportation, investment holding, property holding and investment, and merchandise trading.
overall speaking, the market conditions of the group’s marine transportation business had improved considerably during the year, primarily due to the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the pandemic, amid the market uncertainties brought by the russia-ukraine war, the intermittent disruptions to the global supply chain owing to congestions of some main ports including the ones in china, and the rising inflation and interest rates resulted in slower economic growth in some major economies in the latter part of the year.
for fy2022, the group reported an increase in revenue by 27% to us$12,372,000 2021: us$9,738,000, driven by the increase in revenue of the marine transportation business, and recorded a profit attributable to owners of the company of us$1,123,000 2021: us$10,488,000.
marine transportation for fy2022, the revenue of the group’s marine transportation business increased by 35% to us$12,079,000 2021: us$8,976,000, and with its profit increased by 38% to us$5,436,000 2021: us$3,938,000.
the increases in revenue and profit of the operation were mainly attributed to the improved market conditions of the marine chartering industry and the general increase in charter rates of the group's vessels during the year.
there has been a revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the covid pandemic, including the full re-activation of major economies including china, the us and europe, notwithstanding the market uncertainties brought by the russia-ukraine war, the intermittent disruptions to the global supply chain owing to congestions of some main ports including the ones in china, and the fast rising inflation and interest rate hikes in some countries including the us which hindered their economic growth.
following the success of many governments in containing the social impact of the pandemic, and the relaxation of anti-covid measures in many countries, there has been a full revival of economic activities worldwide and global trade has regained momentum.
the bdi, which is closely correlated to market freight rate, remained volatile during fy2022 by reaching its peak of over 3,300 points in august 2022, and was hovering between the 1,500 to 2,500 points level for much of the year, compared to the 2,000 to 3,000 points level in 2021.
the current market outlook worldwide.
in view of the prevailing market conditions, the group is prudently optimistic about the prospects of the marine transportation business in the medium to long term.
the carrying capacity of the group's dry bulk fleet, which currently comprises three supramax size vessels, is approximately 171,000 dead weight tonnage.
the group has yet to acquire a second-hand supramax vessel as the price of this vessel type has increased significantly since 2021, however, there are signs recently that the second-hand dry bulk vessel market is softening compared to its peak in around mid-2022 and some buying opportunities have emerged.
the group has not yet identified a suitable target vessel as of the date of this annual report.
nevertheless, the group will continue with its plan of acquiring a second-hand dry bulk vessel, and may include the panamax size carrier with greater carrying capacity i.e.
about 75,000 dead weight tonnage than supramax as its target vessel type, which will allow more options to the group.
the group will inform shareholders of any update of the vessel acquisition as and when appropriate. 6 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 management discussion and analysis at 31 december 2022, with reference to the then prevailing market conditions including second-hand prices of similar vessels in terms of country of build, tonnage and age and market freight rate, an impairment loss on vessels amounted to us$797,000 2021: reversal of impairment loss of us$13,430,000 was recognised in fy2022, which partly offset the group's profitable results for the year.
investment holding the group's investment holding business contributed a revenue of us$293,000 2021: us$581,000 and recorded a loss of us$1,104,000 2021: us$4,843,000 for fy2022.
the revenue of the business represented allowance for credit losses on debt instruments i.e.
corporate bonds at fair value through other comprehensive income "fvtoci" of us$1,402,000 2021: us$5,360,000.
the recognition of the credit losses was primarily a result of the further deterioration of the financial position of the issuers of the corporate bonds held by the group during fy2022.
these bond issuers are all property companies based in the mainland and their credit ratings have been withdrawn or downgraded by the credit rating agencies, and some of the bonds held by the group are in default status due to non-payments of interest and/or principal.
as the group expected the uncertainties of the financial position of these bond issuers would ultimately affect the collection of contractual cash flows from their bonds, a net allowance for credit losses on debt instruments at fvtoci of us$1,402,000 2021: us$5,360,000, which mainly reflected the significant increase of credit risks of these bonds, was recognised during the year.
the group had engaged an independent qualified professional valuer to perform an impairment assessment on these debt instruments under the expected credit losses "ecl" model.
the measurement of ecl is a function of the probability of default and the estimation of default magnitude as if there is a default, and the assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data and forward-looking information.
the estimation of ecl reflects an unbiased amount that is determined with the respective risks, the magnitude of the loss, and also probability-weighted as the weights, and also the group’s debt instruments for the year.
in determining the ecl on the group's debt instruments, the management had worked closely with the independent qualified professional valuer and taken into account factors including the withdrawal or downgrading of credit rating of the bond issuers by the credit rating agencies, the defaults of the bond issuers in their payments of interest and/or principal, and forward-looking information including the future macroeconomic conditions affecting the operations of the bond issuers.
during the year, the group continued to invest in listed corporate bonds.

the transaction was approved by the company’s shareholders in a special general meeting held on 28 april 2022 and was completed on 6 june 2022.
upon completion of the disposal, a loss on disposal of us$183,000 representing the direct expenses related to the disposal was recognised, which largely accounted for the loss incurred by the business for the year of us$196,000 2021: us$313,000.
during fy2022, the group’s property holding and investment business had no revenue 2021: us$181,000 as the investment property, being an office unit at shun tak centre, sheung wan, hong kong, was vacant during the year before it was disposed of.
the group is not holding any investment property at present and will look for acquisition opportunities of investment properties with good rental yield and/or high appreciation potential.

the group intends to resume the business when market conditions improve.
share of result of a joint venture for fy2022, the loss of the joint venture shared by the group amounted to us$758,000 2021: profit of us$87,000 and was mainly related to the decrease in fair value of an industrial property in shanghai, china held under the joint venture, the property is vacant at present and is intended for leasing.

the decrease in the group’s profit was mainly attributed to the recognition of impairment loss on vessels of us$797,000 2021: reversal of impairment loss of us$13,430,000, though partly offset by i the increase in profit contribution from the group’s marine transportation operation to us$5,436,000 2021: us$3,938,000; and ii the decrease in net allowance for credit losses on debt instruments at fvtoci to us$1,402,000 2021: us$5,360,000. 8 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 management discussion and analysis financial review liquidity, financial resources and capital structure during fy2022, the group financed its operation mainly by cash generated from operations, credit facilities provided by a financial institution as well as shareholders' funds.

the significant increase in current ratio was mainly attributed to the net proceeds received from the disposal of an investment property with carrying value of us$8,756,000 during the year, which in turn led to the increase in bank balances.
at 31 december 2022, the equity attributable to owners of the company amounted to us$61,138,000 2021: us$61,452,000, decreased by us$314,000 compared with the prior year end and was mainly a result of the net decrease in fair value of debt instruments at fvtoci of us$2,439,000 2021: us$3,862,000, after offsetting the profit earned by the group of us$1,123,000 2021: us$1,048,000 during the year.
at the year end, the group’s borrowings represented loans from a financial institution mainly applied for financing the holdings of vessels.
the borrowings comprised a non-current portion of us$756,000 2021: us$4,878,000 and a current portion of us$2,122,000 2021: us$4,908,000, totalling us$2,878,000 in light of the fast rising interest rate.
at 31 december 2022, the borrowings were denominated in united states dollars, bore interest at floating rates, and were secured by two vessels owned by the group.
the following is an analysis of the group's borrowings and maturity profile: table: group data : , 2022: , 2021: : current service cost, 2022: 844,395, 2021: 925,486 : within a period not exceeding one year, 2022: 2,122, 2021: 4,908 : within a period of more than one year, 2022: 756, 2021: 2,122 : but not exceeding two years, 2022: -, 2021: 2,756 the amounts due are based on the scheduled repayment dates set out in the loan agreements.
courage investment group limited annual report 2022 9 management discussion and analysis for fy2022, the group’s finance costs of us$346,000 2021: us$447,000 represented mainly interests for the borrowings, finance costs decreased by 23% was mainly a result that the group had fully repaid a bank loan of us$2,786,000 in march 2022.
the group’s gearing ratio, calculated on the basis of total borrowings of us$2,878,000 2021: us$9,786,000 divided by total equity of us$61,138,000 2021: us$61,452,000, was at a low ratio of about 5% 2021: 16% at the year end.
with the amount of liquid assets on hand as well as the credit facilities granted by a financial institution, the management is of the view that the group has sufficient financial resources to meet its ongoing operational requirement.
use of proceeds from the open offer in january 2021, the company successfully raised us$9,148,000 before expenses by way of an open offer of 548,851,784 offer shares with aggregate nominal value of us$548,851,784 at the subscription price was fixed the closing price of the company’s shares was hk$0.193 on the day when the record date the “open offer”.
the net proceeds from the open offer were us$8,621,000 equivalent to a net subscription price of approximately hk$0.12 per offer share, of which a sum of us$2,821,000 was utilised as intended to repay a bank revolving loan to achieve immediate saving in finance costs, whilst the remainder of the net proceeds of us$5,800,000 was earmarked as working capital for the group’s marine transportation business.
as opposed to the original intention to apply approximately 50% of the remainder of the proceeds to its marine transportation business, approximately 40% to its investment holding business and approximately 10% to its merchandise trading business as working capital, the net proceeds from the open offer were not applied as would be the case as the merchandise trading and investment holding businesses as the group was not active in its merchandise trading business and activities primarily owing to the adverse economic impact brought by the prolonged continuation of the covid pandemic.
the company has therefore earmarked the remaining net proceeds of us$5,800,000 as working capital for the group’s marine transportation business before any acquisition of a vessel is proceeded with.
such working capital would be continually be used and replenished in the course of operation on an ongoing basis.
owing to the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the covid pandemic, the outlook of the marine transportation industry has improved and remained positive, the price range of the second-hand supramax vessels with varying specifications that are under consideration by the management has increased to around us$13 million to us$16 million, about 50% higher than the management’s original estimate of us$7 million to us$12 million back in 2021, but lower than the second-hand dry bulk vessel market in around mid-2022.

the management is in the course of evaluating certain vessel buying opportunities and it is still the group’s intention to reutilise the remaining net proceeds of the open offer of us$5,800,000 to acquire a second-hand dry bulk vessel, and may include the panamax size carrier with greater carrying capacity i.e.
about 75,000 dead weight tonnage than supramax as its target vessel type, which will allow more options to the group.

some of these risks are ongoing factors which the industry has to cope with in the medium to long term.
other risk factors are specific to the group.
economic risk the prolonged continuation of the covid pandemic, the heightened political and economic tensions between china and the us, and the russia-ukraine war were the major factors that resulted in the volatility of bdi during fy2022.
the bdi, which has a close correlation to freight rate, was at its peak of over 3,300 points in may 2022, hit its low of about 1,000 points in august 2022, and was hovering between the 1,500 to 2,500 points level for much of the year.
the movement of bdi is outside of the group's control and would have a material effect on the financial performance of the group's marine transportation business.
the global economic conditions and the state of international financial and investment markets, including the economy, financial and investment markets of the us, mainland china and hong kong, of which the group has no control, have significant influence on the financial performance of the group's investment holding business.
market risk the group’s marine transportation business is operating in a rather volatile market.
the business of dry bulk cargo carriers is subject to demand for chartering services and supply of vessels by cargo shippers in the region as well as the worldwide market.
the group is therefore facing intense competition among shippers.
financial risk the group is exposed to financial risks relating to foreign currency, interest rate, credit and liquidity in its ordinary course of business.
details of such risks and management policies are set out in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.
environment risk the group is constantly exposed to inherent risks such as oil spills, pollution, collisions, mechanical breakdown of its vessels, adverse weather conditions, fire or other calamity.
any of these factors may cause disruptions to the group's marine transportation business and result in loss or damage to its vessels or cargo.
the group may also be liable for damages or compensation payable and its existing insurance may not be able to cover all claims fully or its costs may increase significantly.
this may adversely affect the financial performance of the group's marine transportation business.
customer risk the group has been relied on a small number of customers in the last few years.
this has been limiting the group's bargaining power on freight rates and flexibility in freight contract options.
the group may not be able to expand its customer base in the short to medium term in light of the prevailing competitive market conditions which may adversely affect the financial performance of the group's marine transportation business. 12 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 management discussion and analysis supply chain risk the group sources goods and products from a wide range of suppliers.
the cooperation is based on well-entrenched relationship and fair terms of trade between the group and its suppliers.
however, the group cannot warrant that the relationship with each supplier will remain unchanged, in the event the group is unable to reach agreement upon reasonable terms with any suppliers and cannot find suitable substitute suppliers, the group's marine transportation business may be affected.
compliance with relevant laws and regulations as far as the board and the management are aware, the group has complied in material respects with the relevant laws and regulations that have significant impact on the businesses and operations of the group.
during the year, there was no material breach of or non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations by the group.
relationship with employees, customers and suppliers the group understands the importance of maintaining good relationships with its employees, customers and suppliers to meet its immediate and long-term business goals.
during fy2022, there were no significant disputes between the group and its employees, customers and suppliers.
environmental policies and performance the group is committed to the long-term sustainability of the environment and communities in which it operates.
the group is closely following the rules and regulations of the international maritime organisation "imo".
the imo sets out a number of regulations and guidelines for the shipping industry that include safety, environment, human, technical, legal and security elements.
the group has established internal control systems and procedures based on these rules, especially the international safety management code.
the group's internal control systems are subject to annual review and audit by the imo compliance agents.
the group is working vigorously to improve its performance in order to follow and match the ever-changing requirements of the industry and the imo in particular.

the results of the materiality assessment are used to formulate strategy, set targets, and determine the focus of the esg report.
materiality assessment enables the group to analyse business risks and opportunities, which support the sustainable development of its businesses.
the group values the feedback of stakeholders and their opinions on which esg aspects they consider material.
with the assistance of the group’s management, a list of material esg issues has been identified based on the group’s businesses, the esg reporting guide, and an analysis of industry peers.
during fy2022, the group conducted a materiality assessment survey to prioritise the identified material esg issues.
management and employees of different business units and departments were invited to evaluate the significance of the identified esg issues to the stakeholders and the group’s businesses.
based on the results of the survey, the group compiled the materiality matrix below.

environmental the group is committed to mitigating its environmental impacts and incorporating sustainability into its business strategy.
to enhance decarbonisation and address stakeholders’ concerns, which are reflected in the identified material esg issues, the group has set environmental targets in regard to greenhouse gas emissions, waste management, energy consumption and water use.
by doing so, the group further demonstrates its commitment to environmental protection.
the group regularly reviews the progress towards these targets and the effectiveness of its environmental protection measures; further details are set out in the below sections under aspects a1 and a2.
a1.
emissions the group recognises the importance of operating its business in a sustainable manner.
as such, the group continuously improves existing policies and incorporates new policies with the intention of mitigating potential direct and indirect negative environmental impacts arising from the group’s business operations.
during fy2022, the group was not aware of any material non-compliance with laws and regulations that would have a significant impact on the group, including but not limited to the air pollution control ordinance, waste disposal ordinance, and water pollution control ordinance of the laws of hong kong.
air emissions as a group engaged in the business of marine transportation, the three vessels owned by the group were leased out on a time charter basis virtually throughout the whole of fy2022.
the fuels used by the vessels were therefore not under the direct control of the group but the charterers, although the group understood that the use of fuels by the charterers, in all material respects complied with the relevant environmental rules and regulations.
the group considers that the air emissions directly produced by the group during fy2022 were immaterial.
greenhouse gas emissions the principal greenhouse gas emissions produced by the group were from purchased electricity scope 2 and office paper disposal scope 3.
during fy2021, the group has set a target to reduce the total greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 10% by the year ended 31 december 2026 “fy2026”, using fy2021 as the baseline year.
to achieve the set target, the group has adopted the following measures to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions, indirect greenhouse gas emissions and other indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
scope 1 - direct greenhouse gas emissions during fy2022, the three vessels owned by the group were virtually leased out throughout the whole of fy2022, and as the group did not own any vehicles, the group’s operations did not produce any direct greenhouse gas emissions.
scope 2 - indirect greenhouse gas emissions electricity consumption accounted for the indirect greenhouse gas emissions produced by the group.
the group has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption, the measures are set out in the section headed "energy efficiency" under aspect a2 below.
courage investment group limited annual report 2022 37 environmental, social and governance report scope 3 – other indirect greenhouse gas emissions paper waste disposal by employees accounted for the other indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
measures implemented to reduce paper waste disposal are set out in the section headed “waste management” under aspect a1 below.
during fy2022, the group’s total greenhouse gas emissions intensity increased by 19.23% from approximately 0.26 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per employee in fy2021 to approximately 0.31 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per employee in fy2022.
this was mainly due to an increase in business activities.
the group is in the process of achieving the aforementioned target and will continue to promote measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
summary of greenhouse gas emission performance: indicator1 fy2021 : scope 2 – indirect greenhouse gas emissions- purchased electricity 3.59 scope 3 – other indirect greenhouse gas emissions- paper waste disposed at landfills 0.51 total greenhouse gas emissions 4.10 total greenhouse gas emissions intensity3 0.26 notes: 1.
greenhouse gas emissions data is presented in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and is based on, but not limited to, “the greenhouse gas protocol: a corporate accounting and reporting standard” issued by the world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development, “how to prepare an esg report – appendix 2: reporting guidance on environmental kpis” issued by the hong kong stock exchange, the “global warming potential values” from the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 and the sustainability report 2022 published by hk electric. 2.
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent is defined as metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. 3.
as at 31 december 2022, the group had 16 2021: 16 employees including directors of the company.
this data is also used for calculating other intensity data in this esg report.
waste management hazardous waste management owing to the group’s business nature, no material hazardous waste was produced by the group during fy2022. 38 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 environmental, social and governance report non-hazardous waste management most of the non-hazardous waste produced by the group was office paper.
although its operations do not generate a significant amount of non-hazardous waste, the group endeavours to further reduce the waste produced by implementing "green office" initiatives.
during fy2021, the group has set a target to provide waste separation bins for collecting recyclables, including paper, plastic, and glass in the group's office from fy2022 onwards.
furthermore, the group will continue to implement waste reduction measures, such as those listed below, with the goal of reducing waste from the sources.
the green measures include but are not limited to the following: - print electronic correspondences only when necessary; - reuse single-sided office paper; - encourage double-sided printing or photocopying; - procure paper bearing the forest stewardship council recycled label; and - recycle outdated office supplies and electronic equipment after their life cycles.
during fy2022, the group's total non-hazardous waste intensity increased by about 28.57% from approximately 0.007 metric ton per employee in fy2021 to approximately 0.009 metric ton per employee in fy2022.
this was mainly due to an increase in business activities.
the group has provided waste separation bins for collecting recyclables during fy2022 in order to achieve the aforementioned target.
the group will continue to promote measures to reduce paper consumption and provide waste separation bins for recyclables in the future.
summary of non-hazardous waste discharge performance: table: non-hazardous waste discharge performance category: , unit: , fy2022: , fy2021: category: office paper, unit: metric ton, fy2022: 0.151, fy2021: 0.107 category: total non-hazardous waste, unit: metric ton, fy2022: 0.151, fy2021: 0.107 category: total non-hazardous waste intensity, unit: metric ton/employee, fy2022: 0.009, fy2021: 0.007 sewage discharges into water and land owing to the group's business nature, the group's business activities do not consume a significant volume of water during its daily operations, and thus it does not generate a material portion of sewage.
as wastewater from the group will be connected to a regional water purification plant, the water consumed by the group is considered sewage discharged.
further details of water consumption are set out in the section headed "water consumption" under aspect a2 below.
environmental, social and governance report a2.
use of resources the group upholds and promotes effective use of resources and is committed to optimising their use across business operations.
the group keeps track of the esg-related kpis through its internal monitoring programme on procurement and use of resources and established relevant policies and procedures in resource management.
energy efficiency during fy2022, the energy consumed by the group was mainly electricity used for daily operations, which was an indirect energy consumption.
as all of the group’s vessels were leased out virtually throughout the whole of fy2022, the group had no direct energy consumption during the year.
nevertheless, to promote energy conservation and enhance energy efficiency in business operations, the group has set a target in fy2021 to change all office lighting to led bulbs by fy2026.
the group also adopts the following energy-saving measures: - post eye-catching stickers on energy conservation as a reminder to employees; - switch off unnecessary lighting and electrical appliances when not in use; - purchase energy-efficient equipment to replace retired equipment; - set all computer screens and printers to standby mode after a certain period; and - participate in energy-saving campaigns, including the earth hour lights-out campaign.
the group will investigate anomalies in electricity consumption to identify the root causes and carry out the corresponding preventative measures.
during fy2022, the group’s total energy consumption intensity increased by approximately 24.06% from approximately 316.38 kilowatt-hours per employee in fy2021 to approximately 392.50 kilowatt-hours per employee in fy2022.
this was mainly due to an increase in business activities.
the group is currently making progress in achieving the aforementioned target, and will continue to enhance its energy conservation measures in order to reduce energy consumption.
summary of energy consumption performance: table: energy consumption type of energy: , unit: , fy2022: , fy2021: type of energy: indirect energy consumption, unit: kilowatt-hours, fy2022: 6,280.00, fy2021: 5,062.00 type of energy: - electricity, unit: kilowatt-hours, fy2022: 6,280.00, fy2021: 5,062.00 type of energy: total energy consumption intensity, unit: kilowatt-hours/employee, fy2022: 392.50, fy2021: 316.38 notes: data includes the energy usage trends from 2021 to 2022, and shows that the energy consumption has increased in the areas of electricity and total energy consumption. 40 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 environmental, social and governance report water consumption owing to the group’s business nature, the usage of water is confined to water used by employees in the office.
water consumption data was not available since water usage was covered in the office building management fees.
the target for water efficiency is also not presented, as water consumption data is not available.
although the water consumption of the group is insignificant, the group is dedicated to promoting the importance of water conservation to its employees.
apart from posting eye-catching stickers to promote water conservation, the group also regularly inspects water taps to prevent leakage and encourages employees to cherish water usage, such as by reducing unnecessary water consumption in washrooms and pantry.
the group did not encounter any problems in sourcing water that was fit for its purpose and was not aware of any abnormal water usage during fy2022.
use of packaging material owing to the group’s business nature, the use of packaging material is not considered a material esg aspect of the group.
a3.
the environment and natural resources although the core business of the group has a remote impact on the environment and natural resources, the group realises its responsibility to minimise any negative environmental impacts from its business operations as an ongoing commitment to good corporate social responsibility.
the group regularly assesses the environmental risks of its businesses, adopts relevant policies and preventive measures to reduce the risks and ensures compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.
during fy2022, the group had placed “green” deposits with banks as part of the pools of funds designated for financing green projects.
indoor air quality to ensure that the group’s work environment is pleasant, the indoor air quality in its workplace is regularly monitored.
during fy2022, the indoor air quality of the group’s office was satisfactory.
to improve indoor air quality, air purifying equipment is used in the office when considered appropriate and the air conditioning system is cleaned periodically.
these measures maintained the indoor air quality at a satisfactory level by filtering out pollutants, contaminants and dust particles.
the group believes that running an environmentally sustainable business model could greatly lower operational risk and in turn generate a more stable return to the group and its shareholders.
the group is endeavoured to achieve this goal in the long term.
a4.
climate change mitigation and adaptation the group recognises the importance of identifying significant climate-related issues and mitigating of the related risks and is thus committed to managing the potential climate-related risks that may impact the group’s business activities.
the group has an established risk management policy to govern the identification and mitigation of different risks, including climate-related risks.
during fy2022, the group conducted a climate change assessment to identify and mitigate the potential risks that may arise from its business operations.
these risks mainly stem from the following dimensions: courage investment group limited annual report 2022 41 environmental, social and governance report physical risks the increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as typhoons, storms, and heavy rains can disrupt the group’s operations by causing floods, damaging the power grid and communication infrastructures, and hindering and injuring its employees and seafarers hired through crew agencies when they are at work or in commute.
these could result in temporary, permanent or partial halt of the group's business operations, which exposes the group to risks associated with non-performance and delayed performance.
besides, the extreme weather conditions may cause damage to the group’s vessels, resulting in substantial maintenance, repair or replacement costs.
other risks posed by extreme weather conditions such as the risk of detention, sinking, collision and other marine disasters could also significantly hinder the operations of the group's marine transportation business.
any damage to the vessels may cause environmental pollution, including but not limited to fuel leakage and disposal of vessel debris.
in certain circumstances, severe weather conditions could cause loss or damage to cargo and property, which would affect the group’s financial performance and require significant resources for remedies if any accidents occurred.
to better manage the aforementioned physical risks, the group has evaluated the possible extreme weather events that could influence the group's business operations and has included the relevant risks in the group's risk management system.
moreover, the group has formulated a crisis response plan to reduce the negative impacts brought by extreme weather events.
when extreme weather events occur or are expected to occur, senior management will respond as planned and communicate with employees about the work solutions for employees to follow, so the employees know how to respond if any of the essential work arrangements become unavailable due to extreme weather events.
transition risks policy and legal risks the group anticipates that there will be more stringent climate legislation and regulations to support the global vision of carbon neutrality.
from a listed company’s perspective, the group acknowledges the increasing requirements for climate-related information and disclosures.
in addition, climate change may lead to higher emissions standards and higher requirements for climate change compliance in vessels.
failure to meet the compliance requirements may harm the group’s corporate reputation and expose it to higher risks of claims and lawsuits.
the group expects the related capital investment and compliance costs to increase accordingly.
in response to policy and legal risks, as well as reputation risks, the group regularly monitors existing and emerging trends, policies and regulations relevant to climate change, and ensures the senior management is aware of any changes in policies or legislation in order to avoid unnecessary costs or non-compliance fines, and to reduce reputation risks resulting from delayed responses.
the group has also included the above-mentioned transition risks in its risk management system, which will be reviewed regularly. 42 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 environmental, social and governance report market risk under the advocation of "net zero", which refers to an ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and the global vision of decarbonisation, there are an increasing number of investors who advocate for combating climate change.
if the group fails to implement effective measures to manage climate risks, investors may drive high level of divestment.
to cope with the potential risk of divestment, the group intends to maintain a high level of transparency in esg reporting between the group and investors.
the group also sets targets for and endeavours to make progress in its esg-related issues.
the group also reviews the matters to ensure the group's development is aligned with the global trend.

basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements and significant accounting policies continued impairment on property, plant and equipment and right-of-use asset continued where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units in prior years.
a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
leases definition of a lease a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
for contracts entered into or modified on or after the date of initial application, the group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under ifrs 16 at inception date.
such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.
the group as lessee allocation of consideration to components of a contract for a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.
non-lease components are separated from lease components and are accounted for by applying other applicable standards.
right-of-use asset the cost of right-of-use asset includes: - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; - any initial direct costs incurred by the group; and - an estimate of costs to be incurred by the group in dismantling and removing the underlying assets, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease.
right-of-use asset is measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.
right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
the group presents right-of-use assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements and significant accounting policies continued financial instruments continued interest income which is derived from the group's ordinary course of business is presented as revenue.
financial assets classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income "fvtoci": - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both selling and collecting contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
all other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss "fvtpi".
i amortised cost and interest income interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for financial assets measured subsequently at amortised cost and debt instruments subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income "fvtoci".
for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial instruments calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired see below.
for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period.
if the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the beginning of the reporting period following the determination that the asset is no longer credit-impaired.
for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial instruments, interest income is recognised by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from the initial recognition.
the calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit-impaired financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired. 76 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 no content was generated for page 77.

geographical information the group’s operations are principally located in hong kong and other asian countries.

information about the group’s revenue from external customers/sources other than marine transportation business is presented based on the geographical location of the operations.
information about the group’s non-current assets other than marine transportation business is presented based on the geographical location of the assets.

property, plant and equipment continued the estimated useful lives of the assets are summarised as follows: vessels - shorter of 30 years or the estimated remaining useful life of the second-hand vessels - dry-docking 2.5 to 5 years - furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 years - leasehold improvement 5 years during the year, the bdi remained volatile compared with that of the prior year.
hence, the directors of the company conducted a review of the recoverable amount of the group's vessels whereby an impairment loss on a vessel is recognised when the carrying amount of a vessel exceeds its recoverable amount, which in turn is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
the fair value of the group's vessels were determined based on the valuation carried out by jp assets consultancy limited, an independent qualified professional valuer not connected to the group, and the market approach was principally adopted for the valuation as there was a known market for used vessels.
the fair value of the vessels were primarily determined based on the direct comparison method by making reference to the recent sale transactions of similar vessels with similar age and condition level 2 fair value hierarchy.
at 31 december 2022, the fair value less costs of disposal of two vessels of the group were determined with reference to prevailing market conditions including second-hand prices and freight rate of similar vessels and amounted to us$30,225,000 2021: us$31,971,000 in aggregate, such fair values are higher than their respective value in use.
as the recoverable amounts of these vessels were lower than their individual carrying amount before impairment, an impairment loss on vessels of us$797,000 was recognised in profit or loss during the year 2021: an impairment loss on vessels of us$13,430,000 was reversed as the recoverable amounts of the vessels were higher than their individual carrying amount.
details of the pledge of property, plant and equipment are set out in note 30.

details of the financial instruments are disclosed in the respective notes.
the risks associated with the group’s financial instruments include market risk currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below.
the management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner. 104 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2022 34.
financial instruments continued b financial risk management objectives and policies continued currency risk most of the group's assets and liabilities are denominated and settled in hong kong dollars or united states dollars.
as hong kong dollars is pegged to united states dollars, the management thus considers the group's foreign currency exposure is not significant.
the group has certain cash and cash equivalents denominated in renminbi which are considered as insignificant, as such, foreign currency sensitivity analysis is not presented.
the group will consider entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against its foreign currency exposure if the risk is considered to be significant.
interest rate risk the group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to bank deposits see note 22 and lease liabilities see note 26.
the group is also exposed to cash flow interest rate risk primarily relating to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings at the end of the reporting period which carry variable interest rates, as disclosed in notes 22 and 25 respectively.
the group has not entered into any interest rate swaps to mitigate its exposure associated with fluctuations in interest rates.
however, the management monitors interest rate exposure and will consider necessary actions when significant interest rate exposure is anticipated.
the group's exposures to interest rates on financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section below.
the company consider that the changes in interest rates of cash and cash equivalents have no significant impact on the group and the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk of such balances is not presented.
the directors of the group arising from the group's variable-rate borrowings.
the sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for variable-rate borrowings at 31 december 2022 and 2021.
the analysis is prepared assuming the variable-rate borrowings outstanding at the end of the reporting period were outstanding for the whole reporting year.
a 300 basis points 2021: 100 basis points possible change in interest rates.
if interest rates had been 300 basis points 2021: 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held, the group’s profit for the year ended 31 december 2022 would decrease/increase by us$86,000 2021: us$98,000.
interest rate benchmark reform a fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of libor with alternative nearly risk-free rates.
as at 31 december 2022, all libor settings have been either ceased to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative, except for us dollar settings other than the 1-week and 2-month settings which will be ceased immediately after 30 june 2023.
courage investment group limited 105 annual report 2022 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2022 34.
financial instruments continued b financial risk management objectives and policies continued interest rate risk continued risks arising from the interest rate benchmark reform arising from the transition period for contracts which have not been transitioned to the relevant alternative benchmark rates and without detailed fallback clauses, if the bilateral negotiations with the group’s counterparties are not successfully concluded before the cessation of libor, there are significant uncertainties with regard to the interest rate that would apply.
this gives rise to additional interest rate risk that was not anticipated when the contracts were entered into.
there are fundamental differences between interbank offered rates the “ibors” and the various alternative benchmark rates.
ibors are forward-looking term rates published for a period e.
grams. 3 months at the beginning of that period and include an inter-bank credit spread, whereas alternative benchmark rates are typically risk-free overnight rates published at the end of the overnight period with no embedded credit spread.
these differences will result in additional uncertainty regarding floating rate interest payments.
progress towards implementation of alternative benchmark interest rates the borrowings with carrying amount of us$2,878,000 2021: us$7,000,000 are linked to libor and have not been transitioned to alternative interest rate, but the relevant loan agreements include fallback clauses to change the basis for determining the interest cash flows which is to be separately agreed by the group and the lenders.
the management closely monitors the interest environment and will start the negotiation with the lenders in appropriate timing in the forthcoming year.
credit risk and impairment assessment bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents the credit risks on bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents are limited because the counterparties are banks/financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 106 courage investment group limited annual report 2022 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2022 34.
financial instruments continued b financial risk management objectives and policies continued credit risk and impairment assessment continued amount due from a joint venture the group regularly monitors the business performance of the joint venture.
the group's credit risks in this balance is mitigated through the value of the assets held by the joint venture and the power to jointly control the relevant activities of the joint venture.
the initial recognition and the group performed impairment assessment based on 12m ecl.
for the years ended 31 december 2022 and 2021, the group considered the ecl for the amount due from the joint venture is insignificant and thus no loss allowance is recognised.
other receivables for other receivables, the directors of the company make periodic individual assessment on the recoverability of other receivables based on historical settlement records, past experience, quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportive, and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort.
the directors of the company believe that there are no significant increase in credit risk of these amounts since initial recognition and the group performed impairment assessment based on 12m ecl.
for the years ended 31 december 2022 and 2021, the group considered the ecl for the other receivables is insignificant and thus no loss allowance is recognised.
debt instruments at fvtoci all of the group's debt instruments at fvtoci are corporate bond investments listed on either the hong kong stock exchange or sgx-st which were acquired in previous years.
at 31 december 2022, all the issuers of these bond investments are property developer companies based in the prc.
since these bond investments are listed and external credit ratings are available, the group maximises the use of these ratings in the determination of ecl on these bond investments.
on the basis of the prevailing market conditions in the prc facing by these property developers, and that their debt instruments, as at 31 december 2022, were/had been in default for interest payments and/or principal repayments, the debt instruments are therefore regarded as credit-impaired or purchased or originated credit-impaired.
out of the us$1,330,000 have issuers of two of the debt instrumentswith total principal amount of us$1,330,000 have completed the negotiation of settlement schemes with their creditors.
the settlement schemes include terms for i settlement of partial outstanding amounts, ii extension of maturity with implementation of instalment settlement patterns; iii undertaking provided by the issuers to apply the proceeds from sale or financing of their assets including but not limited to properties projects held by those issuers or joint ventures of those issuers for the settlement of the outstanding amounts; and iv keepwell intention to assist the issuer concerned to meet its repayment obligations.
the group has participated in these schemes in order to reduce its credit loss exposure.

the impact of the above settlement schemes are also reflected in the measurement of loss given default.
the applicable loss given default adopted in determining the ecl for the current year ranged from 65% to 93% 2021: 44% to 90%.
the group has also applied a higher adjustment factor for forward-looking information applicable to the bonds issued by these prc property developer companies to reflect the higher loss on these debt instruments, also reflects the financial uncertainties of these bond instruments.
the calculation of ecl follows the conditions of the property market in the prc and the price movements of these debt instruments, and will formulate appropriate exit strategy accordingly subject to market conditions prevailing from time to time.
during the year, principal of certain debt instruments totalling us$2,450,000 were redeemed.
