principle 2: board composition and guidance there should be a strong and independent element on the board, able to exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs independently, particularly from management.
no individual or small group of individuals should dominate the board's decision-making.
the board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.
as at 31 march 2022, the board comprised four members: two independent non-executive directors mr. rajan ganapathy and mr. frederick r. walsh, jr , one non-independent non-executive director mr. wu fengji . page 9 corporate governance report and one executive director and ceo namely, mr. lai wing chong . during fy2022, the chairman was independent and independent directors made up at least one-third of the board pursuant to rule 210 5 c of the listing manual.

the board currently comprises six members.
five of the directors are independent non-executive directors namely, mr. rajan ganapathy, mr. frederick r. walsh, jr, mr. osith ramanathan, mr. dennis goh hao kwang and mr. bernard oh, with mr. goh as the interim independent and non-executive chairman and one of the directors is a non-independent and non-executive director namely, mr. bambang sugeng bin kajairi . the chairman is an independent director and currently, the independent and non-executive directors make up a majority of the board in accordance with provision 2.3 of the code.
each director is appointed based on the strength of his calibre, experience and potential to contribute to the company and its business.
the board is of the view that, given the group's current scope of business operations, the current board size and composition, which comprise members with specialized industry knowledge as well as others with diverse skills, experience and attributes, provides for effective direction for the group.
the nc will review the composition of the board periodically to ensure that the board has the appropriate mix of expertise and experience and collectively possess the necessary core competencies for effective functioning and informed decision-making.

the nc also reviews and determines the independence of each director on an annual basis based on the guidelines provided by the code and the rules in the listing manual.
the criterion for independence goes beyond the definition given in the code.
the board considers an “independent" director as one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment, and has no relationship with the company, its related companies, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director's independent judgment of the conduct of the group's affairs in the best interests of the company.

the profiles of each of the directors are set out in the “board of directors" section of this annual report, including details of the listed company directorships and principal commitments of each director in accordance with provision 4.5 of the code.
particulars of interests of directors who held office at the end of the financial year in shares, debentures, warrants and share options in the company and in related corporations other than wholly-owned subsidiaries are set out in the directors' statement on page 43 of this annual report.
jasper investments limited corporate governance report principle 3: chairman and chief executive officer there should be a clear division of responsibilities at the top of the company—the working of the board and the executive responsibility of the company's business—which will ensure a balance of power and authority, such that no one individual represents a considerable concentration of power or has unfettered powers of decision-making.
the company notes the recommendation that the roles of the chairman and the ceo should be separate and distinct, each having their own areas of responsibilities.
for fy2022, the operations of the company were taken care of primarily by the executive director, the then ceo of the company, mr. lai wing chong.
the independent chairman during fy2022 was mr. chan wai kwong michael resigned on 30 october 2021 , who was succeeded by the former executive chairman now a non-executive non-independent director , mr. bambang sugeng bin kajairi.

following the resignation of the former ceo, mr. wu fengji, the company has recently identified a candidate, ms. perlin chan aik ju, to take the position of ceo with effect from 17 october 2023 as recently announced.

in that position, mr. dennis goh hao kwang chairs the board of directors and is primarily responsible for the effective working of the board.
all the former ceos/acting ceos are not related to the chairman of the company.
mr. rajan ganapathy is currently the lead independent director and ac chairman of the company.
in accordance with provision 3.3 of the code, mr. ganapathy has made himself available for shareholders to reach out to him in situations where there are concerns and where communications with the ceo, the chairman or any of the other key position holders has failed to resolve such concerns or may be inappropriate or inadequate.
as lead independent director, mr. ganapathy can also facilitate periodic meetings with the other independent directors and/or non-executive directors in board matters, when necessary and provides feedback to the ceo and the chairman after such meeting.
his other specific roles as lead independent director include: a acting as liaison between the independent directors and/or non-executive directors and the ceo and/or the executive chairman and lead the independent directors and/or non-executive directors to provide non-executive perspectives in circumstances where it would be inappropriate for the ceo and/or the chairman to serve in such capacity and to contribute a balanced viewpoint to the board; b advising the ceo and/or the chairman as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the information submitted by management that is necessary or appropriate for the independent directors and/or non-executive directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties; and c assisting the board and officers of the company in better ensuring compliance with and implementation of corporate governance.
principle 4: board membership there should be a formal and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the board and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the board.

under provision 4.2 of the code, the lead independent director should be a member of the nc.
for fy2022, the then lead independent director, mr. chan wai kwong michael resigned on 30 october 2021 , was a member.
the group will appoint the current lead independent director, mr. rajan ganapathy, to the nc.

the nc and the board review the number of listed company board representations annually or as needed.

on behalf of the board of directors dennis goh hao kwang independent and non-executive director bambang sugeng bin kajaire non-independent and non-executive director dated: 28 september 2023 page 41 independent auditor's report to the members of jasper investments limited report on the audit of the financial statements disclaimer of opinion we were engaged to audit the financial statements of jasper investments limited the "company" and its subsidiary the "group" . these include the consolidated statement of financial position of the group and the statement of financial position of the company as at 31 march 2022, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
we do not express an opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
because of the significance of the matters described in the basis for disclaimer of opinion section of our report, we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion on these financial statements.
basis for disclaimer of opinion going concern the group incurred a net loss after tax for the year of united states dollar550,000 and reported net operating cash outflows of united states dollar622,000 for the financial year ended 31 march 2022. as at 31 march 2022, the group and the company had a deficit in equity of united states dollar1,061,000 and united states dollar1,049,000 and net current liabilities of united states dollar199,000 and united states dollar187,000, respectively.
these factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast a significant doubt on the group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern.
the directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis based on the assumptions as disclosed in note 2 a to the financial statements.
the assumptions are premised on future events the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.
based on the information available to us, we have not been able to obtain sufficient audit evidence to satisfy ourselves as to the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption in the preparation of the financial statements.
if the group and the company are unable to continue as a going concern, the group and the company may be unable to discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business, and adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other than in the normal course of business and at amounts which could differ significantly from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the statements of financial position.
in addition, the group and the company may have to provide for further liabilities that might arise, and may need to reclassify non-current assets as current assets, respectively.
no such adjustments have been made to the financial statements.
recoverable amount of right-of-use assets note 5 the recoverable amount is the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal.
the group did not determine value-in-use nor fair value less costs of disposal of right-of-use asset as at 31 march 2022. in the absence of a management's assessment of the recoverable amount at the reporting date, we were unable to determine whether any adjustment to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset as at 31 march 2022 was necessary.
any adjustment necessary to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset as at 31 march 2022 would have a consequential effect on profit or loss for the year ended 31 march 2022, and accumulated losses and total equity as at 31 march 2022. jasper investments limited independent auditor's report report on the audit of the financial statements continued basis for disclaimer of opinion continued convertible loan note note 10 the group did not assess the classification of the convertible loan note, issued during the financial year ended 31 march 2022, as to whether it contains a liability component with an equity component convertible bond contains equity component or a liability component with a derivative liability component convertible bond contains liability and derivative components , and did not account for subsequent measurement of the derivative liability component related to a convertible instrument with embedded derivative, as applicable, pursuant to sfrs i 1-32 financial instruments: presentation and sfrs i 9 financial instruments.
we were unable to determine what the classification of the convertible loan note and the carrying amount of the components a liability component with an equity component or a liability component with a derivative liability component contained therein as at 31 march 2022, and the effect of subsequent measurement, as applicable, on profit or loss for the year ended 31 march 2022 should have been had the convertible loan note been properly classified since inception.
functional currency the functional currency of an entity reflects the underlying transactions, events and conditions relevant to the company and the subsidiary.
in prior years, management determined the united states dollar the “us dollar” to be the functional currency of the company and the subsidiary as the us dollar was the currency that mainly influenced the group’s revenue derived from provision of vessels management services and the associated cost of sales.
the group did not derive revenue from operations since the financial year ended 31 march 2019. during the financial year ended 31 march 2022, the company completed a funding from issuance of a convertible loan notes note 10 denominated in the singapore dollar.
management did not reassess whether changes in the group’s operations, and the currency in which the debt funding obtained by the company and the group’s operating expenses were denominated warranted a change in the functional currency of the company and the subsidiary.
responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the companies act, chapter 50 the “act” and singapore financial reporting standards international “sfrs i s” , and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
the directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

1. general information the financial statements of the group and the company for the year ended 31 march 2022 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on the date of the directors' statement.
the company is incorporated as a limited liability company domiciled in singapore and is listed on the singapore exchange securities trading limited sgx-st . the registered office and principal place of business of the company is located at 10 collyer quay 27-00 singapore 049315. the principal activity of the company is that of an investment holding company.
the principal activities of the subsidiary are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
2 a . basis of preparation these consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise described in the notes below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 1967 and singapore financial reporting standards international . the financial statements are presented in united states dollars.
all financial information has been presented in united states dollars, unless otherwise stated.
going concern the group incurred a net loss after tax for the year of united states dollar550,000 and reported net operating cash outflows of united states dollar622,000 for the financial year ended 31 march 2022. as at 31 march 2022, the group and the company had a deficit in equity of united states dollar1,061,000 and united states dollar1,049,000 and net current liabilities of united states dollar199,000 and united states dollar187,000, respectively.
these factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast a significant doubt on the group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern.
in the opinion of the directors, the group and the company are able to continue as a going concern for the following reasons: a the company has entered into a subscription agreement with an unrelated party by which the subscriber the "subscriber" has agreed to subscribe to 674,603,174 new ordinary shares the "subscription shares" in the capital of the company at the aggregate subscription price of approximately singapore dollar2,000,000 the "issue consideration" . completion of the issue of the subscription shares is no later than 31 october 2023 the "completion date" , unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing between the subscriber and the company.
the issue consideration shall be satisfied by: i on or before 1 june 2023, the subscriber shall remit or procure to be remitted singapore dollar500,000 which amount will be treated as an interest-free advance or loan extended by the subscriber pending the completion date to the company; and b on the completion date or, subject to such terms and conditions as the subscriber and the company may mutually agree, such earlier date , the subscriber shall remit an amount in singapore dollar equivalent to the issue consideration less any amount paid pursuant to i above ; and the subscription shall be subject to specific shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened.
b the company is exploring potential fund raising.
notes to the financial statements 2 a basis of preparation cont'd going concern cont'd if the group and the company are unable to continue as a going concern, the group and the company may be unable to discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business, and adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other than in the normal course of business and at amounts which could differ significantly from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the statements of financial position.
in addition, the group and the company may have to provide for further liabilities that might arise, and may need to reclassify non-current assets as current assets, respectively.
no such adjustments have been made to the financial statements.
significant accounting estimates and judgements the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with sfrs i requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial year.
although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
the critical accounting estimates and assumptions used and areas involving a significant judgement are described below.
significant judgements in applying accounting policies identification of functional currencies the functional currency for each entity in the group is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
determination of functional currency involves significant judgment and other companies may make different judgments based on similar facts.
the functional currency of each of the group entities is principally determined by the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates.
the group reconsiders the functional currency of its entities if there is a change in the underlying transactions, events and conditions which determine their primary economic environment.
the determination of functional currency affects the carrying value of non-current assets included in the statement of financial position and, as a consequence, the amortisation of those assets included in the income statement.
it also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement.
key sources of estimation uncertainty impairment of right-of-use asset note 5 right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any objective evidence or indication that these assets may be impaired.
an impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell.
when value in use calculation notes to the financial statements 2 a basis of preparation cont'd significant accounting estimates and judgements cont'd key sources of estimation uncertainty cont'd impairment of right-of-use asset note 5 cont'd is undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit by applying a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
when fair value less costs to sell is used, management uses the value estimated by professional valuers to determine the fair values using valuation techniques which involve the use of estimates and assumptions which are reflective of current market conditions.
the group and the company did not determine value-in-use nor fair value less costs of disposal of the plant and equipment and right-of-use asset as at 31 march 2022. the carrying amount of the group and the company's right-of-use asset are disclosed in note 5. convertible loan note note 10 the determination of whether a convertible loan contains a liability component with an equity component or a liability component with a derivative liability component involves significant judgement.
the group did not assess the classification of the convertible loan note, issued during the financial year ended 31 march 2022, as to whether it contains a liability component with an equity component convertible bond contains equity component or a liability component with a derivative liability component convertible bond contains liability and derivative components , and did not account for subsequent measurement of the derivative liability component related to a convertible instrument with embedded derivative, as applicable, pursuant to sfrs i 1-32 financial instruments: presentation and sfrs i 9 financial instruments.
2 b interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2022 on 1 april 2021, the group and the company have adopted all the new and revised sfrs i , sfrs i interpretations “sfrs i int" and amendments to sfrs i , effective for the current financial year that are relevant to them.
the adoption of these new and revised sfrs i pronouncements does not result in significant changes to the company's accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts or the disclosures reported for the current or prior reporting periods.
2 c frs issued but not yet effective at the date of authorization of these financial statements, the group and the company have not adopted the new and revised sfrs i , int sfrs i and amendments to sfrs i that have been issued but are not yet effective.
management anticipates that the adoption of these new and revised sfrs i pronouncements in future periods will not have a material impact on the group and the company's financial statements in the period of their initial application.
2 d summary of significant accounting policies consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary as at the end of the reporting period.
the financial statements of the subsidiary used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the company.
consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
all intragroup balances, income and expenses and unrealized gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
a subsidiary is consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control and continues to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
losses and other comprehensive income are attributable to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
if the group loses control over a subsidiary, it: - de-recognizes the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts as at that date when control is lost; - de-recognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest; - de-recognizes the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity; - recognizes the fair value of the consideration received; - recognizes the fair value of any investment retained; - recognizes any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; - re-classifies the group's share of components previously recognized in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
a subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the group.
the group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
thus, the group controls an investee if and only if the group has all of the following: - power over the investee; - exposure, or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
there are also no images or footnotes to include.
jasper investments limited and its subsidiary notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 march 2022 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd consolidation cont'd - the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
the group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
when the group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.
the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the group's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including: - the size of the group's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders; - potential voting rights held by the group, other vote holders or other parties; - rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and - any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the group has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders' meetings.
changes in the group's ownership interests in subsidiary that do not result in the group losing control over the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions.
the carrying amounts of the group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the group.
when the group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between i the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and ii the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill , and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.
all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable sfrs i s . the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when the control is lost is regarded as the fair value on the initial recognition for subsequent accounting under sfrs i 1-39, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
investment in subsidiary investment in subsidiary is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any, on an individual subsidiary basis.
plant and equipment, and depreciation all items of plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
the cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying page 54 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd plant and equipment, and depreciation cont'd plant and equipment.
the cost of an item of plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
when significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the group and the company recognise such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively.
likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
all other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
depreciation on the plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the depreciable amount over their estimated useful lives as follows: furniture and fittings: 1 year computer: 3 years the carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
the residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
for acquisitions and disposals during the year, depreciation is provided from the month of acquisition and to the month before disposal respectively.
fully depreciated plant and equipment are retained in the books of accounts until they are no longer in use.
an item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year the asset is derecognised.
notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
1 financial assets measurement initial recognition and measurement financial assets are recognized when, only when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
the classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the group and the company's business model for managing them.
with the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the group has applied the practical expedient, the group and the company initially measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the group and the company expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of a third party if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.
in order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income “oci” , it needs to give rise to cash flows that are “solely payments of principal and interest "sppi" on the principal amount outstanding.
this assessment is referred to as the sppi test and is performed at an instrument level.
the group and the company's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows.
the business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.
purchase or sales of financial assets that required delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place regular way trades are recognized on the trade date, i.e. the date that the group and the company commit to purchase or sell the asset.
subsequent measurement for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: - financial assets at amortized cost debt instruments . - financial assets at fair value through oci with recycling of cumulative gains and losses debt instruments . - financial assets designated as fair value through oci with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition equity instruments . notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd 1 financial assets cont'd measurement cont'd subsequent measurement cont'd - financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
- financial assets at amortized cost debt instruments financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment.
gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired, and through the amortization process.
subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the group and the company's business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
the group and the company's financial assets at amortized cost include bank balances, other receivables excluding prepayments and amount due from subsidiary.
fair value through other comprehensive income “fvoci" financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fvoci.
financial assets measured at fvoci are subsequently measured at fair value.
any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in profit or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial assets measured at amortized cost.
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is de-recognized.
the group and the company do not have financial assets that are measured at fvoci.
financial assets designated as fair value through other comprehensive income equity instruments the group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value.
on initial recognition of an equity instrument that is not held for trading, the group and the company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in oci.
the classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
dividends from such investments are to be recognized in profit or loss when the group and the company's rights to receive payments is established.
notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd 1 financial assets cont'd measurement cont'd subsequent measurement cont'd financial assets designated as fair value through other comprehensive income equity instruments changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss.
changes in fair value of financial assets at fvoci recognised in oci are never recycled to profit or loss.
dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit and loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in oci.
equity instruments designated at fvoci are not subject to impairment assessment.
the group and the company do not have financial assets that are designated as fair value through other comprehensive income equity instruments . financial assets at fair value through profit or loss assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fvoci are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value.
financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.
notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fvoci, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
a gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss statement in the period in which it arises.
interest income from these financial assets is included in the finance income.
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
the group and the company do not have financial assets that are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
page 58 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd 1 financial assets cont'd derecognition a financial asset or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is primarily derecognised i.e. removed from the group's consolidated statement of financial position when: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and either a the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b the group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
when the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.
when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.
in that case, the group also recognises an associated liability.
the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the group has retained.
impairment of financial assets the group and the company assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses “ecl” associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost.
ecl are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.
the expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
ecls are recognised in two stages.
for credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ecls are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months a 12-months ecl . for those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default a lifetime ecl . for non-trade amount due from subsidiary, expected credit loss is assessed based on whether the subsidiary has sufficient accessible highly liquid assets to repay the amount to the company if demanded at the reporting date.
notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd i financial assets cont'd the group and the company consider a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days due.
however, in certain cases, the group and the company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the group and the company are unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the group.
a financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
ii financial liabilities initial recognition and measurement financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
these financial liabilities comprise other payables and loan from shareholder.
borrowings which are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of reporting period are included in current borrowings in the statement of financial position even though the original terms was for a period longer than twelve months and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the end of reporting period.
borrowings to be settled within the group's operating cycle are classified as current.
other borrowings due to be settled more than twelve months after the end of reporting period are included in non-current borrowings in the statement of financial position.
borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the related asset.
otherwise, borrowing costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
borrowing costs consist of interest and other financing charges that the group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use are in progress and the expenditures for the qualifying asset and the borrowing costs have been incurred.
capitalisation of borrowing costs cease when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets are substantially completed for their intended use.
subsequent measurement they are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
page 60 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd ii financial liabilities cont'd derecognition the group and the company derecognise a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
the group and the company also derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.
on derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss.
iii cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.
compound financial instruments convertible bond with conversion option is separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract.
the liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.
the equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component.
transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are initially recognised.
subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.
when an equity conversion option is exercised, the carrying amounts of the liability component and the equity conversion option are derecognised with a corresponding recognition of share capital.
convertible bond contains equity component convertible bond with conversion option is separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract.
on issuance of the convertible bond, the embedded option is recognised at its fair value as derivative liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
the remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the liability component that is carried at amortised cost until the liability is extinguished on conversion or redemption.
transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are initially recognised.
page 61 there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd convertible bond contains equity component cont'd when an equity conversion option is exercised, the carrying amounts of the liability component and the equity conversion option are derecognised with a corresponding recognition of share capital.
convertible bond contains liabilities and derivative components on initial recognition, the derivative component of the convertible bond is recognised at fair value.
any excess of proceeds over the amount initially recognised as the derivative component is recognised as the liability component.
transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and derivative components of the convertible bonds based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and derivative components when they are initially recognised.
the portion of the transaction costs relating to the liability component is recognised initially as part of the liability.
the portion relating to the derivative component is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
in subsequent periods, the liability component of the convertible bond is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the derivative component is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
leases the group as lessee the group and the company assess whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract.
the group and the company recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases defined as leases with a lease term of twelve months or less and leases of low value assets.
for these leases, the group and the company recognize the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.
a lease liability the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease.
if this rate cannot be readily determined, the group and the company use the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee.
the incremental borrowing rate is defined as the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.
lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: fixed lease payments including in-substance fixed payments , less any lease incentives; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd leases cont'd the group as lessee cont'd a lease liability cont'd exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.
variable lease payments that are not based on an index or a rate are not included as part of the measurement and initial recognition of the lease liability.
the group and the company shall recognize those lease payments in profit or loss in the periods that trigger those lease payments.
for all contracts that contain both lease and non-lease components, the group has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components and account these as one single lease component.
the lease liabilities are presented as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.
the lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost, by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability using the effective interest method and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.
the group and the company remeasure the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to nil whenever: the lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used ; or a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.
b right-of-use asset the right-of-use asset comprises the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs.
they are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
page 63 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd financial instruments cont'd leases cont'd the group as lessee cont'd b right-of-use asset whenever the group and the company incur an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under sfrs i 1-37.
to the extent that the costs relate to a right-of-use asset, the costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.
depreciation on right-of-use assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amounts over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset, as follows: office premise : over lease term of 12.5 months if a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group and the company expect to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
the depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.
the right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.
the group and the company apply sfrs i 1-36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss.
share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity.
incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares are deducted against the share capital account.
income taxes current income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of reporting period.
deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting or taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
a deferred income tax liability is recognised on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiary, except where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
jasper investments limited and its subsidiary notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 march 2022 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd income taxes cont'd a deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.
employee benefits short-term employee benefits short-term benefit obligations, including accumulated compensated absences, are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
a provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the group and the company have a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided.
defined contribution plans a defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.
key management personnel key management personnel are those persons having the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity.
directors of the company and its subsidiary and certain managers are considered key management personnel.
related parties a related party is defined as follows: a a person or a close member of that person's family is related to the group and company if that person: i has control or joint control over the company; ii has significant influence over the company; or iii is a member of the key management personnel of the group or company or of a parent of the company.
b an entity is related to the group and the company if any of the following conditions applies: i the entity and the company are members of the same group which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others ; ii one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member ; iii both entities are joint ventures of the same third party; page 65 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd related parties cont'd iv one entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity; v the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the company or an entity related to the company.
if the company is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the company; vi the entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in a ; vii a person identified in a i has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity or of a parent of the entity ; or viii the entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.
impairment of non-financial assets the carrying amounts of the group and the company's non-financial assets subject to impairment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
if any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, then the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs will be identified.
for the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units . as a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.
all individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value-in-use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
any impairment loss is charged to profit or loss, unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged to equity.
an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognised.
notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd revenue recognition revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the rendering of services, net of goods and services tax, rebates and discounts.
revenue is recognised when the group and the company satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service.
a performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time.
the amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.
revenue from provision of services is recognised when the services are rendered.
interest income interest income is recognised on a time-apportionment basis using the effective interest method.
government grants government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the group and the company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the group and the company recognise as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the group and the company with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.
functional and presentation currency items included in the financial statements of each entity in the group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates “functional currency” . the financial statements of the group and the company are presented in united states dollars, which is also the functional currency of the company.
conversion of foreign currencies transactions and balances in a currency other than the functional currency “foreign currency” are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
currency translation differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss.
non-monetary items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined.
non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
page 67 notes to the financial statements 2 d summary of significant accounting policies cont'd conversion of foreign currencies cont'd the results and financial position of all the entities within the group that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the end of reporting period; ii income and expenses for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income including comparatives shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of transactions; and iii all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the exchange reserve.
on the disposal of a foreign operation i.e. a disposal of the group's entire interest in a foreign operation or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation , all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that foreign operation attributable to the group are reclassified to profit or loss.
any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss.
operating segments an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group's other components.
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.
the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the chief executive officer who makes strategic resources allocation decisions and assesses segment performance.
currently, the group only has one operating segment.
earnings per share the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares.
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible bonds and warrants.

the group's consolidated assets are located in singapore.
no geographical information is presented.
20. financial risk management the group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments.
the key financial risks relevant to the group include foreign currency risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
there has been no change to the group's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis indicated below.
20.1 foreign currency risk currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
currency risk arises when transactions are denominated in foreign currencies.
the group has transactional currency exposures arising from expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of the respective group entities.
the currency that gives rise to foreign currency risk is the singapore dollars singapore dollar . a 5% strengthening of the singapore dollar against the functional currencies of the respective group entities at the reporting date would have decreased equity and profit or loss before tax as follows: table: impact of 5% singapore dollar strengthening on equity and profit 2021-2022 entity: the group, singapore dollar movement: strengthened 5% against united states dollar, loss before tax usthousands of singapore dollars 2022: 52, equity usthousands of singapore dollars 2022: 52 , loss before tax usthousands of singapore dollars 2021: 7, equity usthousands of singapore dollars 2021: 7 entity: the company, singapore dollar movement: strengthened 5% against united states dollar, loss before tax usthousands of singapore dollars 2022: 51, equity usthousands of singapore dollars 2022: 51 , loss before tax usthousands of singapore dollars 2021: 7, equity usthousands of singapore dollars 2021: 7 table end.
this analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
the analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and does not take into account the associated tax effect.
a 5% weakening of the singapore dollar against the functional currencies of the respective group entities would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amount shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
20.2 interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
the group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as it does not hold any variable rate financial instruments.
20. financial risk management cont'd 20.3 market price risk price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual security or its issuer or factors affecting all securities traded in the market.
the group does not hold any quoted or marketable financial instrument, and hence is not exposed to any movements in market price.
20.4 credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the group or the company to incur a financial loss.
receivable balances and payment profile of debtors are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
credit risk concentration profile the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
at 31 march 2021 and 2022, there was no significant concentration of credit risk.
exposure to credit risk a summary of the group's exposures to credit risk is as follows: table: summary of group's exposures to credit risk date: 31 march 2022, note: 1 , 12-month/lifetime ecl: 12-month ecl, gross carrying amount usthousands of singapore dollars : 148, loss allowance usthousands of singapore dollars : -, net carrying amount usthousands of singapore dollars : 148 date: 31 march 2021, note: 1 , 12-month/lifetime ecl: 12-month ecl, gross carrying amount usthousands of singapore dollars : -, loss allowance usthousands of singapore dollars : -, net carrying amount usthousands of singapore dollars : - table end.

notes to the financial statements jasper investments limited and its subsidiary for the financial year ended 31 march 2022 20 financial risk management cont'd 20.4 credit risk cont'd i other receivables the group and the company apply the sfrs i 9 general approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a 12-month expected loss allowance for other receivables.
ii amount due from subsidiary expected credit loss allowance on a non-trade amount due from subsidiary is assessed based on whether the subsidiary has sufficient accessible highly liquid assets to repay the amount to the company if demanded at the reporting date.
iii cash and cash equivalents the cash and cash equivalents are held with banks of good credit ratings.
page 81 20.5 liquidity risk liquidity or funding risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet liquidity or funding risk is the risk that the group and the company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments.
liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial asset quickly at close to its fair value.
the group's and the company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of maturities of financial assets and liabilities.
