chairman's statement review of the year for the full year ended 30 june 2021, the group’s total revenue was $1,559,000 2020: $2,153,000 a decline of 28%.
the decline in revenue was due to lower trustee fees from both the corporate and private trust businesses.
income commission was particularly lower on the private trust side owing to the difficult economic environment arising from covid-19.
the group incurred an operating loss before tax for the full year of $1,440,000 2020: loss $757,000.
the increase in loss of 90% is due to lower revenue as highlighted above and an increase in employee expenses due to the company’s expansion of the group.
in december 2020, the group invested s$ 200,000 in a start-up exempt corporate finance advisory services, taurus point capital tpc.
for tpc’s maiden year, the group recorded its share of loss of $34,000 for this financial year.
dividend during the year an interim tax exempt dividend of 1.50 singapore cents per share was paid in march 2021.
the group has decided not to declare a final dividend in view of the development phase that the group has entered into.
in addition to revitalising its trust division, the group will be exploring opportunities to enhance and diversify its revenue and income stream for future growth.
outlook the board recognises that while the domestic trust business in singapore remains competitive, there is a growing interest by foreign wealth managers and international family offices to utilise singapore as a financial base.
with its strong reputation on the regulatory side, strength in legality and integrity, singapore is increasingly viewed as an attractive springboard not only for south-east asia, but north asia and europe as well.
the board is intent in capitalising this advantage, and to grow its trust business and develop synergistic silos over time.
this is reflected in our new hires and investment in a new business.
the journey forward has begun in earnest.
with the increase in human resource, we now have the bandwidth to explore strategic partnerships for its existing trust business and new business opportunities for the group.
in the near term, this will translate to an increase in cost but necessary to drive the group’s future growth.
to-date, covid-19 has impacted our fee income negatively, as it has the singapore economy as a whole.
the board and management will examine ways in which we can mitigate such risks by investing in covid-19 resilient businesses such as tpc.
i would like to take this opportunity to thank existing clients, shareholders, the board and staff for their patience, support and dedication during the covid-19 period and as bmh management explores avenues for future growth.

however, we had started the estate liquidation plan well in advance, this did not have a material impact on our business.
we continue to work and keep in close contact with our major suppliers and look to address any issues as they occur.
in the majority of cases, the key areas we require services from are covered by numerous vendors and we believe we could change our suppliers with minimal disruption to our business.
community a number of the estates and trusts we manage provide distributions to beneficiaries of the estates or to various charities.
these distributions are dependent on the income received by the estate or trust and are dependent on rental or dividend income received which may be potentially impacted during this period.
to try and minimize the impact on the distributions, we have and continue to look at costs and attempt to reduce discretionary expenses where possible.
sustainability report focus 5: energy and paper usage global reporting initiative 301-1, 302-1, 306-1, 306-2 we make a constant effort to remind our employees to switch off the lights and gadgets such as their computers when they are not in use to minimise our energy consumption and reduce the environmental impact of our day-to-day operations.
the group is attentive to how our paper is sourced and produced as it is used regularly in our operations.
our supplier sources our paper from a sustainable and high quality source in thailand that has established a sustainable supply of trees through growing hybrid hardwood on unused land in between rice paddies.
it has also created shared value to the farmers and their local community, helping to improve the living conditions of more than 1.5 million farmers across thailand through incremental income earned from planting trees.
focus 6: corporate social responsibility global reporting initiative 413-1 the group's activities can create positive impact on society through charitable contributions from trust funds managed by bmt.
some estates have made provisions to distribute funds to help less fortunate people with their daily needs.
as another example of its charitable work, bmt is the trustee of a trust that provides bursaries for students in the field of marine engineering on behalf of one of our customers.
every year, a number of bursaries are paid out of the investment returns of this fund, with a local singapore polytechnic school deciding who the bursaries are awarded to.
in all cases, the group safeguards our clients' original investments to ensure the long-term sustainability of the trust funds' purpose.

independent auditor's report to the members of british and malayan holdings limited key audit matters cont’d assessing the adequacy of the accounting of the monies held in trust for customers the group's principal operations include the provision of trustee services that are conducted by its subsidiary, british and malayan trustees limited "bmt".
bmt handles large sums of customer's money in the course of its work or agents in receiving, holding or paying out sums of monies on behalf of its customers or third parties.
bmt is required to comply with the trust companies act chapter 336 to ensure that the customers' monies received by bmt in its fiduciary capacity as trustee are properly accounted for in accordance of the trust companies act chapter 336 and are kept distinct and separated from its own monies and so that the trust monies do not form part of, or are not mixed with, its general assets.
we identified that the proper accounting of the monies held in trust as a key audit matter because there is a potential risk of inaccurate accounting of bmt’s cash accounts by virtue of its principal business which involves handling voluminous transactions involving customers’ monies held in trust accounts that includes the receiving, holding or paying out sums of monies for its customers or third parties.
in response to this risk, our audit procedures included, amongst others, the following: - we reviewed and tested management’s processes and controls surrounding proper segregation and appropriate recognition of monies held in trust in the customers’ accounts; - we performed testing of outflows on monies to verify whether these transactions are for valid purposes and appropriately supported by requisite documentation; - we circularised bank confirmations for trust bank accounts, reviewed the year end bank reconciliations for trust bank accounts and verified to underlying supporting documents such as invoices and bank advices to ensure that the reconciling items are appropriate; and - we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements in relation to the group’s cash and cash equivalents in note 17.

trade and other receivables : , group: : , company: a the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting year is shown above and is expected to be recognised as revenue within 1 year.
the expected credit losses ecl on the trade receivables and accrued income are based on the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses ecl which uses a lifetime ecl allowance approach for all balances recognised at initial recognition.
the reporting entity has only a few customers and which can be credit risk graded individually and these are recorded at inception net of expected lifetime ecl.
for these large balances, at the end of the reporting year a loss allowance is recognised if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
no loss allowance was necessary for the large balances.
at every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic are analysed.
the amounts are written off when there are indications that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery or the failure of a debtor to make contractual payments over an extended period.
there are no collateral held as security and other credit enhancements for the trade receivables.
as part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used.
the average credit period generally granted to trade customers is between 30 days 2020: 30 days.

the credit risk concentration profile of trade receivables at the end of the reporting year is as follows: : , 2021: , 2020: the other receivables shown above are subject to the expected credit loss model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments.
the other receivables can be graded for credit risk individually.
at inception they are recorded net of expected 12 month credit losses.
at each reporting date, an evaluation is made whether there is a significant change in credit risk by comparing the debtor’s credit risk at initial recognition based on the original, unmodified cash flows with the credit risk at the reporting date based on the modified cash flows.
adjustments to the loss allowance is made for any increase or decrease in credit risk.
at the end of the reporting year a loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
no loss allowance was necessary.
other receivables are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity.
related company other receivables are regarded as of low credit risk if they are guaranteed by the parent or a related company with the ability to settle the amount.
