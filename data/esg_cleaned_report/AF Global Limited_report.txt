we recognise our responsibility to protect the environment for the health and well-being of future generations.
5.1.2 reduction of carbon footprint we recognise that the effective management and monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value.
our carbon footprint is measured in terms of greenhouse gas greenhouse gas emission.
however, greenhouse gas emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon 5. stakeholder engagement greenhouse gas emission index the chart shows the greenhouse gas emission index kgco₂e / singapore dollar million from 2018 to 2022. note that the 2020 and 2021 figures are marked with a ^ symbol, indicating low revenue due to the covid-19 pandemic.
5.1.3 reduction of paper consumption our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work by adhering to our internal guidelines.
for example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing drafts.
we have implemented a digital document management system with an aim to improve operational efficiency, security, and reduce paper consumption.
we hope to eventually evolve into a paperless working environment.
considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time.
to this end, we have set a target for a reduction in paper consumption of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. in fy2022, we consumed a total of 3,509 kilograms of paper.
the paper consumption index stands at 269 kilograms per singapore dollar million of revenue, which is 21% higher than our base year 2017. we reduced paper consumption in kilograms by 44% from our base year 2017 with the digitalisation of certain processes but the low revenue as explained in section 5.1.2 above resulted in a higher index.
as a result, the index may not be comparable to prior years with normalised business activities.
we will continue to monitor our paper consumption and work towards our 2030 goal.
paper consumption index the chart shows the paper consumption index kilograms / singapore dollar million from 2018 to 2022. the 2020 and 2021 figures are marked with a ^ symbol, indicating low revenue due to the covid-19 pandemic.

5 stakeholder engagement 5.1.4 promoting green practices our hotel has been implementing green solutions suitable for its operating environment.
green solutions are initiatives that the hotel can implement to progressively improve its operation practices toward its sustainability goals.
each green solution lays out the steps that the hotel must take to implement the solution.
such initiatives are to be implemented through areas such as design, operational procedures and adaptation of green technologies to achieve objectives such as reducing energy, water and waste, cutting carbon emissions, improving guest health and comfort as well as reducing operating and maintenance costs.
examples of green solutions range from using energy-efficient lighting and lighting controls, installing water-efficient bathroom fixtures to using energy efficient appliances or any other alternative energy sourcing, using heat pump to replace heavy oil in generating heat for hot water and replacing swimming pool water sand filters with more efficient grid filters.
our hotel also aims to raise employees' and guests' awareness about environmental issues.

by attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment conducive for innovation and inspiration which will boost our competitiveness.
our business operates in an environment with diverse races, cultures and geographic locations.
with this in mind, our human resource hr polices take into consideration the prevailing laws and regulations as well as local culture, norms and sensitivity.

we achieve this through our various communication sessions customised based on the target employees.
communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis.
the agendas covered at these sessions are customised as appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers.
5.2.2.2 employee feedback we value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities.
therefore, their feedback is important in the improvement of overall management and operations of the organisation.
through various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, performance review, as well as exit interviews in events of resignations, we gather valuable feedback for continuous improvements to the organisation.
in addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as the whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues.
this policy allows staff to raise their concerns in confidence about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters.
we also accept anonymous reports to ensure that independent investigations of such matters are carried out and that appropriate follow-up action is taken.

5.2.4.1 retirement and healthcare our group has presence overseas where there are local laws and regulations on pension and healthcare for employees.
our hr management practices comply with these applicable laws and regulations.
5.2.5 safety and health in the workplace we are committed to workplace safety and health and take precautions to prevent occupational injuries among employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for our guests.
we believe that safe work conditions will also boost employees' morale.
we work closely with ihg and the hotel's executive committee, to create monitoring, reporting, and assurance protocols, to oversee key areas of uncertainty and manage the effectiveness of risk management and internal control arrangements, including in relation to safety and security.
ihg's brand safety standards are also implemented, which specify reasonable and practicable measures to mitigate foreseeable health, safety and security risks.
full, selected or sample inspections were conducted periodically to ensure compliance to ihg's brand safety standards.
ihg's brand safety standards are also designed to anticipate and identify safety and security risks in an evolving landscape and provide appropriate levels of control necessary to mitigate against significant incidents.
regular meetings by ihg's regional and global subject matter experts in safety and security with hotel operations support teams, such as engineering, food and beverage, rooms and human resources, to review, renew and set operational safety and security policies and procedures.
besides the ihg's brand safety standards, we also constantly sought the feedback of our hotel employees regarding potential safety and health risks and hazards in the workplace.
potential safety and health risks and hazards are being reported to the hotel's executive committee, for their investigation.
the results from the investigation will then be managed through multi-layered training guidance that is specific to improve safety and health for our employees and our guests.
in fy2022, safety trainings were conducted, covering areas such as: tsunami and fire evacuation renewal of electrician licenses certified gas operator licenses hygiene standards food handling certification first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr 5.2.6 individual rights protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations.
labour rights, the prohibition of discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and workplace health and safety are observed within the work environment.
discrimination and harassment are not tolerated.
we also respect our employees' rights to freedom of association as well as their membership with trade unions and other professional bodies.
in fy2022, no incidents of forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human rights-related grievances have been reported.
5.3 focusing on our customers' needs 5.3.1 our approach safety within our hotel premises have always been our key priority.
open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily activities with customer interaction.
in addition to striving for excellence in our product, service and support, we attach importance to data privacy.
we have processes and controls in place over confidential and sensitive data related to our customers.
5.3.2 health and safety providing an accommodating atmosphere that does not compromise safety is the biggest challenge that hotels face.
achieving these goals require a multifaceted plan that starts with staff training and guest education about safety and security issues.
our hotel management consistently enforce established security policies, such as allowing only registered guests on hotel property.
constant planning to stay ahead of these issues is also a must, especially when the hotel hosts public events.
5.3.2.1 access control controlling access is an important part of hotel security planning to prevent criminal activities such as theft from guest rooms.
our contractors and staff are trained in controlling room key distribution and restricting access to registered guests only.
security personnel are stationed at all main access points to greet people, while deterring anyone with no business from entering the property, especially disruptive or intoxicated non-guests.
5.3.2.2 guests education hotel employees have a responsibility to educate guests on safety and security responsibilities.
the challenge for staff is to get the message across without negatively affecting the customer's experience.
for instance, the bellman can gently remind guests the importance of locking room doors to prevent theft when delivering luggage to guests' rooms.
front desk staff can also subtly discourage guests from actions that leave them vulnerable to crime, such as flashing their room key cards with room numbers.
our staff are trained to manage such delicate situations in a professional manner to ensure the safety of our guests.

5 stakeholder engagement 5.3.2.3 public areas patrol technology has come a long way in helping hotels upgrade basic security measures.
closed-circuit tv cameras with recording systems are essential for securing such busy public spaces such as bars, lounges, parking lots, and loading bays.
however, these areas also allow open access to disruptive persons, muggers and pickpockets.
monitoring of the camera images by staff and proper lighting reduces the chances for such crimes.
5.3.2.4 staff training hotel guests can participate in relevant safety programmes carried out by the hotel.
our hotel staff are trained with the objective of ensuring a consistent, professional response to emergencies.
our staff are empowered to take responsibility in addressing unusual behaviour that occurs on hotel property, without jeopardising their own safety.
in addition, training relating to guest services such as language courses, culture awareness and guests interaction are frequently conducted to improve service standards.
5.3.3 data safety and privacy ensuring safety and privacy of our customers' data is our priority.
we handle and communicate sensitive and confidential information of our customers such as guest registration, home addresses and credit card information with due care to ensure our customers' data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality.
we observe local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection.
5.4 partnering our suppliers 5.4.1 our approach our supply chain activities can be split into two broad categories: corporate supply chains and hotel supply chains.
our corporate supply chains cover procurement for our corporate offices.
at the hotel level, supply chains cover procurement for items required for running a hotel and cover a wide range of items including food, linens, cleaning supplies and furniture.
we believe that building strong relationships with our suppliers is essential in achieving sustainable business practices throughout our supply chains.
we recognise that it is a continuously evolving process and hence, we have to be pragmatic in terms of communication and expectation of our key suppliers.
5.4.2 supplier selection our key suppliers are selected through our supplier selection process.
when selecting our key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services and competitiveness of pricing.
our suppliers are also required to abide by ihg's supplier code of conduct, which outlines several criteria such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to the conduct of business, health and safety, labour practices and the environment.
in making business decisions, suppliers are expected to endeavour to reduce their environmental impact.
there should also be no discrimination and no forced and child labour.
our final decision on supplier selection will be based on the overall assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria.
in fy2022, 100% of new suppliers were screened using environmental and social criteria.
5.4.3 supplier review we review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our partnership with them.
such review process allows us to evaluate and ensure that our key suppliers' services and products aligns to our business requirements and sustainability objectives.

6 performance table 6.1 energy usage and co₂ emissions direct and indirect co₂ emissions from fuel and electricity consumptions are measured in greenhouse gas emissions in kgco₂e while electricity consumption is measured in kilowatt hour kilowatt-hours . we purchased fuel and electricity from non-renewable sources.
our business and function grow over time and the greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption patterns vary.
to ensure consistency and comparability of the greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption measures over time, we create a greenhouse gas emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance monitoring.
the index adjusts the greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our activities.
we normalize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities.
the greenhouse gas emission index is measured in kgco₂e per singapore dollar million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kilowatt-hours per singapore dollar million.
table: greenhouse gas emission and electricity consumption index fy2018-fy2023 index: greenhouse gas emission index kgco₂e/singapore dollar million , fy2018: 179,374, fy2019: 198,366, fy2020: 231,353, fy2021: 412,571, fy2022: 216,312, fy2022 target: 384,177 7% , fy2023 target: 208,902 3% index: electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/singapore dollar million , fy2018: 425,592, fy2019: 469,241, fy2020: 541,014, fy2021: 918,148, fy2022: 540,087, fy2022 target: 857,542 7% , fy2023 target: 519,163 4% index: electricity consumption kilowatt-hours , fy2018: 11,780,879, fy2019: 10,961,460, fy2020: 3,667,183, fy2021: 2,445,782, fy2022: 7,057,321, fy2022 target: -, fy2023 target: - table end.
fy2022 performance the greenhouse gas emission index and electricity consumption index stands at 216,312 kgco₂e per singapore dollar million and 540,087 kilowatt-hours per singapore dollar million respectively which are lower than last year.
we have also achieved a 44% and 37% improvement respectively over our fy2022 targets.
the easing of border controls in fy2022 increased occupancy and revenue.
this increase was much higher than the increase in electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours , thereby lowering the greenhouse gas emission index and electricity consumption index.
however, the indexes are 24% and 30% higher than our base year 2017 – greenhouse gas emission index: 174,476 kgco₂e per singapore dollar million; electricity consumption index: 414,102 kilowatt-hours per singapore dollar million . this was due to electricity consumption not decreasing in line with revenue as certain electricity usage is still necessary for the maintenance and hygiene of the hotel regardless of the occupancy rate.
hence, our performance from fy2020 to fy2022 may not be comparable to prior years with normalized business activities.
we have been managing our electricity consumption through various initiatives and will continue to monitor our performance and work towards our 2030 goals of 10% improvement from 2017 level.
6.2 paper consumption we capture the data for paper consumption by the number of packs of 500 sheets of paper used, where one ream is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper.
to ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, such as a3 and a4 papers, we measure paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers.
our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary.
we devise a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring.
the index adjusts the paper consumption for the size of our activities.
we normalise the weight of paper consumed by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities.
the paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per singapore dollar million.
table: paper consumption performance and targets : paper used for office printing : weight of paper consumption kilograms , fy2018: 7,275, fy2019: 5,489, fy2020: 2,021, fy2021: 1,294, fy2022: 3,509, fy2022 target: 1,294, fy2023 target: 3,509 : paper consumption index kilograms/singapore dollar million , fy2018: 263, fy2019: 235, fy2020: 298, fy2021: 486, fy2022: 269, fy2022 target: 454 7% reduction , fy2023 target: 260 3% reduction table end.
fy2022 performance we consumed a total of 3,509 kilograms of paper in fy2022.
the paper consumption index stands at 269 kilograms per singapore dollar million which is 45% lower than last year.
we have achieved a 41% improvement over our fy2022 target.
however, the paper consumption index is 21% higher than our base year 2017 – 223 kilograms per singapore dollar million . we reduced paper consumption in kilograms by 44% from our base year 2017 with the digitalisation of certain processes, but the low revenue as explained in section 6.1 above resulted in a higher index.
hence, our performance from fy2020 to fy2022 may not be comparable to prior years with normalised business activities.
we will continue to monitor our paper consumption and work towards our 2030 goal of 10% improvement from the 2017 level.
6.3 hotel sustainability indicators table: hotel sustainability indicators fy2018-fy2023 indicator: greenhouse gas co₂e emission per occupied room kgco₂e/room , fy2018: 41.9, fy2019: 44.2, fy2020: 67.5, fy2021: 77.5, fy2022: 39.8, fy2022 target: 72.9 5.9% , fy2023 target: 39.3 1.3% indicator: electricity consumption per occupied room kilowatt-hours/room , fy2018: 99.5, fy2019: 104.6, fy2020: 158.1, fy2021: 172.7, fy2022: 99.5, fy2022 target: 163.0 5.6% , fy2023 target: 97.7 1.8% indicator: water consumption per occupied room cubic meters/room , fy2018: 1.9, fy2019: 2.1, fy2020: 4.9, fy2021: 5.7, fy2022: 1.5, fy2022 target: 5.2 8.8% , fy2023 target: 1.5 -- indicator: waste per occupied room kilograms/room , fy2018: 2.8, fy2019: 2.8, fy2020: 2.8, fy2021: 3.5, fy2022: 1.6, fy2022 target: 3.4 2.9% , fy2023 target: 1.6 -- table end.
fy2022 performance: we have achieved our year-to-year performance expectation in fy2022.
we have also achieved our 2030 goal for waste per occupied room of 2.5 kilograms per room.
however, the electricity consumption per occupied room is 5.0% higher than our base year 2017 – 94.8 kilowatt-hours per room . as explained in section 6.1, this was due to electricity consumption not decreasing in line with revenue as certain electricity usage is still necessary for the maintenance and hygiene of the hotel regardless of the occupancy rate.
hence, our performance from fy2020 to fy2022 may not be comparable to prior years with normalized business activities.
we will continue to monitor our performance and work towards our 2030 goals of 10% improvement from the 2017 level.
