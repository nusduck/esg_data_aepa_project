ceo message 2023 was a year of many struggles but also accomplishments and it underscored how the virtues of hard work and perseverance give rise to hope.
challenges were abundant.
the war between russia and ukraine raged on, additional armed conflicts broke out, most notably between israel and hamas, and tensions between the superpowers remained high.
all these complicated geopolitics further and contributed to economic headwinds.
while inflation eased after global central banks aggressively hiked rates, it persisted at elevated levels.
consequently, both consumers and businesses continued to face significant strain.
despite this, a hard landing of the global economy was avoided.
in particular, most of asia's economies remained robust.
china and india, the two most populous economies of the world, both ended the year with a higher growth rate than in 2022.
and the outlook for southeast asian economies improved, as the electronics export cycle bottomed out and travel and tourism continued to recover.
on the climate front, we witnessed an unprecedented number of new records this past year.
june to december were the warmest months on record.
ocean temperatures were the hottest ever measured.
all of this has been exacerbated by the start of el ni√±o, a natural climate shift that tends to raise global temperatures.
but the science is clear, the trajectory of global warming can only be changed if we reduce historically high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at speed and scale.
tragically, the impacts from climate change on the economy and society are becoming ever more evident.
studies have shown that insured and uninsured economic losses resulting from extreme climate-related weather conditions in 2023 were significantly higher than recent averages.
the number of people directly impacted by these calamities reached new highs, with the poor disproportionately affected, worsening social inequalities.
encouragingly, governments and regulators around the world have implemented an increasing number of meaningful policies that support the transition to net zero, which is being complemented by significant efforts of the private sector to transform global industries and supply chains.
globally, investments in clean energy overtook spending on fossil fuel at a ratio of 5:1, according to the international energy agency.
just five years ago, this ratio stood at 1:1.
additionally, 118 countries pledged at the cop28 climate summit to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030.
the electrification of transport has greatly accelerated across markets, and battery production has been scaling up.
nearer to home, asean ramped up its efforts to decarbonise and aims to create green corridors.
china's decarbonisation efforts have been astounding.
for example, in 2023 it installed over half of the world's total renewable power generation capacity, grew to become the world's largest electric vehicle market and exporter, and planted more trees than any other country in the world.

our sustainable financing for loans and trade finance commitments, net of repayments, was around singapore dollar 70 billion as of december." piyush gupta, ceo dbs group holdings from ambition to action against this backdrop, we further refined our approach and leveraged the increased capacity we had built in previous years to double down on various strategic initiatives.
our sustainability strategy remains centred around embedding environmental and social considerations into the fabric of our business via three pillars: 1 responsible banking that seeks to empower our clients to being more sustainable and to promote greater access to essential financial services, 2 responsible business practices that focuses on how we conduct ourselves as an organisation, and 3 impact beyond banking that supports social enterprises and community causes, as well as employee volunteerism.

apart from offering advisory services related to our clients' net zero transition journeys, we translated this engagement into finance ceo message "we committed up to singapore dollar 1 billion over the next 10 years to improve lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged, and foster a more inclusive society" piyush gupta, ceo dbs group holdings stood at around singapore dollar 70 billion as of december, up from singapore dollar 51 billion in the previous year.
we also facilitated close to singapore dollar 18 billion of esg bond issuances in 2023.
we supported global efforts related to the managed and early phase out of coal in asia.
asia has around 5,000 operational coal power plants.
it will be critical to shut them down well ahead of the end of their operating lives to meet the goals of the paris agreement.
this endeavour is very complex, especially given the socio-economic context in asia and the imperative to accomplish this in a just manner.
to this end, we have supported and collaborated in initiatives with research and advocacy efforts to foster a ecosystem approach.
for example, we co-led work related to the public consultation and final report of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero gfanz on 'financing the managed phaseout of coal-fired power plants in asia pacific'.
furthermore, we have acted as financial advisor to the indonesian investment authority 'ina' related to such transactions.
during cop 28, ina and various partners signed a framework agreement and conditionally agreed to shorten the operating life of cirebon-1, a 660 megawatt coal-fired power plant located on java, by around seven years.
in addition to our focus on large corporates, we doubled down on our efforts to help smes in their sustainability efforts.
last year, we established several strategic partnerships with industry leaders to provide more comprehensive solutions to smes.
one example is our renewed collaboration with h&m group, which seeks to accelerate the adoption of green initiatives across the fashion supply chain.
in hong kong, we partnered clp power to support smes' low-carbon transition.
additionally, we signed partnerships with a number of solutions providers such as keppel corp, schneider electric and reset carbon, among others.
furthermore, we engaged over 1,000 smes through various sustainability training courses and programmes to develop their capability and capacity in the field.
next to all these efforts on client engagement, we also further strengthened our esg risk management capabilities.
we enhanced relevant processes and our esg data architecture, created new analytical tools, and formed a new management position, the head of esg credit risk.
in our consumer banking group, we continued our efforts to provide customers with financial planning and an array of investment and financing solutions aimed at helping them to live more sustainably.
for example, we enhanced and expanded our offerings on livebetter, our one-stop digital sustainability platform, which we had launched in 2021.
it is now available in singapore, hong kong and indonesia.
to date, more than singapore dollar 21 million has been invested through invest better in green funds and etfs, and over singapore dollar 2 million donated through give better for environmental and social causes.
financial inclusion, banking the under-banked and nurturing healthy financial planning, has always been a core focus area for us.
last year, we approved over 4,400 unsecured loans totalling singapore dollar 665 million to micro and small businesses to support their working capital needs.
furthermore, we developed a personal finance guidance, the dbs financial planning portal, to achieve holistic financial wellness across the key life stages.
in our responsible business practices pillar, we established the employee experience council to drive four key employee journeys, namely employee well-being, workload, assimilation of new hires and rewards & recognition.
we also launched our flagship women leadership programme which is specifically designed to build, support, and sustain a robust community of senior women leaders and strengthen our pipeline for senior leadership in the bank.
in our procurement, we uplifted our sustainable sourcing principles to encourage suppliers to adopt a socially and environmentally restorative approach in supply of products and services.
furthermore, we implemented a cloud-based data management platform to improve the end-to-end environmental data management.
this will enable us to further sharpen our strategy focused on reducing the environmental footprint of our own operations.
additionally, we materially expanded our sustainability learning campus to deepen knowledge of and empower employees to support our agenda and strategic initiatives.
as one example, we trained over 1,800 relationship managers and credit risk managers to empower them with necessary climate-related knowledge.
foundation also committed another singapore dollar 5.6 million to support 11 new programmes to build future-ready skills and food security among vulnerable segments through its community impact chapter.
recognising our role in society and pursuing our vision last year, dbs marked our 55th anniversary.
with roots as the development bank of singapore, established with the express intent to help singapore's industrialisation, the idea of being sustainable, being relevant to society, doing real things for real people, and therefore having a purpose, has been deeply rooted in our dna.
while we are a different kind of bank today, we have always maintained our strong sense of purpose, and developed our vision to be the best bank for a better world.
this means taking action now to create a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable future for generations to come.
the path ahead is formidable and there is still much to be done.
i am grateful for the hard work and perseverance of dbs employees, as well as our clients and partners, on this journey.
i am confident that our collective efforts and dedication will allow us to accelerate action at scale and speed, to support a future in asia which is greener, and just.
finally, in our impact beyond banking pillar, we committed up to singapore dollar 1 billion over the next 10 years to improve lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged, and foster a more inclusive society.
in addition, our workforce committed to over 1.5 million volunteer hours of training per employee over the next decade to give back to society.
in 2023, the dbs foundation awarded singapore dollar 3.7 million in grant funding to 24 smes and social enterprises across the region through its business for impact chapter.

we have observed good progress in five out of seven sectors, and they track well against the relevant science-informed decarbonisation pathways.
however, we recognise that in very hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel almost on track and shipping not on track, there are dependencies and structural challenges that require long-term changes.
addressing these will often need broader ecosystem partnerships across the public and private sectors.
we remain committed to working with our clients and fostering partnerships to enable an economy-wide transition to net zero that is orderly and just.

we see sustainability as an active value driver that offers new opportunities, builds resilience against esg risks and strengthens trust with our stakeholders.
across the three pillars of our sustainability strategy, we have set metrics and targets, and developed initiatives to drive sustainable outcomes.
we report on our approach and performance against our material esg factors in the following chapters of this report.
supporting sustainable development as a member of the united nations global compact, we have a role to play in promoting sustainable development.

at dbs the board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the bank and has ultimate responsibility of our sustainability strategy and reporting.
it provides constructive challenge and strategic advice to management.
board and board committees in 2022, the board established our board sustainability committee bsc to provide greater governance and oversight on our sustainability agenda, including our net zero commitment, which is a strategic priority for the bank.
the bsc is chaired by dbs group ceo piyush gupta.
its members come from different business backgrounds and bring together complimentary skills and experience.
the bsc members who are also dbs board members, include chng kai fong, judy lee, tham sai choy and david ho, who was newly appointed to the bank's board of directors in april 2023.
in addition to dbs board members, the bsc also comprises of a non-director member and sustainability expert, dr.
ben caldecott, the founding director of the oxford sustainable finance group at the university of oxford smith school of enterprise and the environment.
read more about the profiles of our board of directors in our annual report 2023.
in 2023, the bsc met quarterly and discussed several topics related to sustainability, including, but not limited to: - global themes relevant to dbs and our sustainability strategy.
- sustainability-related developments within dbs.
- climate risk considerations including physical and transition risks, and enhancements to our esg risk assessments.
approach - client engagement on transition planning, as well as green and sustainable financing solutions.
- dbs' approach to disclosures, including adherence to new sustainability-and climate-related reporting standards and frameworks.
the board receives regular updates on key sustainability matters arising from these quarterly bsc meetings.
at dbs, we take an integrated approach to governance of sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities.
the audit committee ac and the board risk management committee brmc also have oversight responsibilities for sustainability-related activities.
in 2023, the ac received regular updates on sustainability-related disclosure requirements, while the brmc discussed and reviewed climate considerations as part of the wider risk management processes.
board statement on sustainability "the board has overall responsibility for the formulation of dbs' sustainability strategy.
the board provides oversight on dbs' sustainability agenda and directs its efforts in managing material esg factors, guided by the objective to create long-term value by managing our business in a balanced and responsible way.
in 2023, the board sustainability committee bsc oversaw the update of our material esg factors, as well as the continued progress to weave social and environmental factors into the fabric of our business, with a greater focus on climate-related matters." dbs group board of directors sustainability governance structure board of directors board: , board sustainability committee: , audit committee: , board risk management committee: board: board, board sustainability committee: oversees progress against our sustainability strategy and climate commitment, audit committee: oversees disclosure matters, board risk management committee: oversees climate-related risk management group sustainability council chaired by the group chief sustainability officer cso council members represented by senior management across: management: , : , : , : management: management, : institutional banking, : consumer banking, : treasury markets management: , : , : , : risk management management: , : technology & operations, : human resource, : group strategic marketing comms/dbs foundation management: , : , : , : group planning standing invitation extended to senior representatives across: : , : , : , : : , : legal & compliance, : internal audit, : strategic planning local sustainability councils china, hong kong, taiwan, india and indonesia project net zero sponsored by the group head of institutional banking, group cro and group cso the project net zero steering committee oversees: : , : , : , : : , : net zero strategy, : esg risk assessment policies and processes, : climate data and technology : , : financed emission assessment, : climate scenario analysis model, : climate-related training from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 8 executive management at the management level, the group sustainability council gsc oversees the execution of sustainability initiatives across the bank.
the gsc is chaired by the group cso and comprises of senior managers from various business and support units.
in 2023, the gsc met quarterly.
given the increasing regulatory and legal relevance of esg matters, internal audit and legal & compliance attend gsc meetings as observers.
this supports a more comprehensive approach to risk management and regulatory compliance, and deeper ethical considerations as we navigate a dynamic and complex sustainability landscape.
the gsc - through the chief sustainability office - coordinates and collaborates sustainability efforts with the five local sustainability councils lscs established in our core markets outside of singapore china, hong kong, taiwan, india and indonesia.
in addition to the gsc, the lscs serve as executive forums for discussions and operational decision-making on sustainability matters.
in 2023, we established a cross-functional steering committee called project net zero, which drives the operationalisation of our climate agenda across our net zero commitment, management and reporting.
sponsored by the group head of institutional banking, group cro and group cso, the steering committee is responsible for the implementation of multiple workstreams that involve different business and support units across the bank.
the project net zero steering committee provides quarterly updates to the bsc as one of the key standing agenda items.
at the start of 2023, the bank established a new esg credit risk team under risk management group along with a new management position - head of esg credit risk - to provide leadership and expertise to further strengthen our climate and esg risk management capabilities.
embedding sustainability into performance management and remuneration we use a balanced scorecard approach to measure how successful we are in serving our key stakeholders and executing our long-term strategy.
sustainability and climate-related targets are incorporated into our group scorecard and cascaded across the relevant units' scorecards, which are used to evaluate performance.
progress made against these targets is then used to determine the compensation for both our management and relevant executing teams, which in turn drives the overall management of sustainability performance across the bank.
management targets cover key sustainability and climate-related themes such as: - governance, processes and reporting systems - climate progress under project net zero - sustainable, green and social products, solutions and services - financial inclusion, financial literacy and digital inclusion - regenerative technology and spaces - talent and people, including talent retention, diversity & inclusion and employee engagement - impact beyond banking through dbs foundation to further strengthen the governance of sustainability at dbs, in 2023 we conducted a holistic review of our sustainability governance processes.
as a result, we have refined our approach including: - establishing an environmental and social incident management guide to ensure timely and appropriate response to any reports of environmental and social incidents.
- establishing a consumer banking governance guide for sustainability labelled products and services to ensure that a robust governance framework and internal controls are in place for products and services, to which a sustainability label is attached.
pillar 1: responsible banking we identified three key sustainability learning priorities and enhanced the dbs sustainability learning campus, considering different target audiences within the bank.
for senior leaders to further our senior management understanding of the business imperatives arising from sustainability risks and opportunities, and support the integration of esg risks and opportunities into strategic decision making, we collaborated with cambridge university‚Äôs institute for sustainability leadership to conduct a full day senior leadership workshop.
the interactive workshop included cases on sustainability best practices and challenging dilemmas, with an emphasis on solving real-world problems.
for all staff to create greater understanding of the relevance of sustainability for the bank across all employees, a suite of sustainability-related training modules was launched in april 2023.
the modules cover a variety of sustainability concepts, as well as communicating dbs' sustainability commitments and progress, and how everyone can participate in this journey.
read more about our bank-wide learning programme in "developing our people" on page 49.
for role-based specialised functions to enable a more structured learning journey based on domain expertise, we have also customised several learning modules for specific departments within the banks.
for example, to operationalise our net zero commitments and build competencies on climate-related risks and opportunities, we conducted climate activation training for our relationship managers rms and credit risk managers crms.

our material esg factors in 2023, we updated our annual review of our material esg factors, following our four-step process.
as a result, we amended two material esg factors to provide a clearer description of their associated impacts, risks and opportunities.
responsible financing was changed to climate change, and building a great corporate culture was changed to employee engagement and culture.
we also created a new topic on the overall resilience of technology at dbs, which includes the previous topic of cyber security.
for all the esg factors listed below, we confirmed their ongoing importance.
finally, we have updated how we present our material esg factors, which are now classified into two categories: strategic esg priorities these form the focus of our strategy for sustainable value creation.
they represent the greatest business opportunities for differentiation and our business-critical risk areas.
they are also the areas where we believe we can have the greatest positive impact on sustainable development.
- climate change - developing our people - financial crime prevention esg fundamentals these form the foundation of sustainability at dbs and underpin our ability to drive long-term value creation and ensure we operate as a responsible and sustainable business.

pillar 1 responsible banking - responsible financing - sustainable living - financial inclusion from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 15 responsible financing supporting asia's transition to a low-carbon economy as a bank, the largest impact we create is through our financing activities.
it is critical that we continually strengthen our capabilities to support a more sustainable, just and prosperous society.
a key priority is accelerating climate action, given its urgency and how it is linked to other environmental and socio-economic challenges.
tackling climate change is a global imperative.
we are already witnessing the impacts of a changing climate, and unless urgent action is taken to decarbonise our economies, these impacts will worsen.
at dbs, we have made significant progress in translating our climate ambition into action.
since becoming a signatory of the net zero banking alliance nzba in october 2021, we announced our net zero commitments and established our very first set of science-informed decarbonisation targets for our scope 3 financed emissions in 2022.
our 2030 and 2050 climate targets guide and direct our lending and financing efforts to support the economy-wide transformation.
our climate strategy to operationalise our climate strategy and commitment to net zero, we have established a dedicated steering committee which provides oversight across policies, processes and platforms.
we are also committed to reporting our progress on an annual basis, and to review our targets and approach at least every five years.

we continue to channel capital towards sustainable activities, finding a right balance between economic growth and inclusive development for all." su shan tan, group head of institutional banking from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 16 client engagement as part of our client engagement strategy, we integrate climate mitigation and adaptation considerations into our sector strategies and account planning process.
we embed our ambition and commitment to net zero in our client engagement, while recognising limitations and challenges different sectors face in their business operations.
this allows us to group clients into archetypes based on their level of maturity in their sustainability journey, and offer financing solutions and advice tailored to their needs.
how we help our clients: - financing solutions to support their pipeline of investment measures, including the establishment of sustainable finance frameworks; - advisory on mitigation of their emissions across their value chain; and - sharing insights on key industry esg considerations, including climate-related risks and opportunities for their sector.
we have engaged our most carbon-intensive clients on net zero planning.
these conversations help us to understand where our clients are on their net zero journey and how dbs could partner with them in their decarbonisation efforts.
we identified and actively engaged at least the top 10 emitters from each of our priority sectors , , , , , , does the client have any transition plans?
is their decarbonisation/ transition plan 1.5¬∞c aligned?: , which reference scenario does the client use if any?: , what are the reasons for not having a transition plan?: is their decarbonisation/ transition plan 1.5¬∞c aligned?: yes, which reference scenario does the client use if any?: yes, what are the reasons for not having a transition plan?: no is their decarbonisation/ transition plan 1.5¬∞c aligned?: yes, which reference scenario does the client use if any?: yes, what are the reasons for not having a transition plan?: no is their decarbonisation/ transition plan 1.5¬∞c aligned?: yes, which reference scenario does the client use if any?: yes, what are the reasons for not having a transition plan?: no almost 90% of the top emitting clients that we have engaged have a net zero plan 1 s&p global commodity insights platts, iata sustainability & economics 1 september 2023 we are encouraged that the vast majority of our top emitting clients already possess a net zero plan.
however, we recognise that many of our clients face these common challenges in their transition to net zero: 1.
certain key technologies for decarbonisation remain nascent and the sectoral ecosystems that support the deployment of these technologies are currently not mature enough for alternatives to become commercially viable.
for example, in 2022, production of sustainable aviation fuel saf comprised only 0.19%1 of overall volume of jet fuel used.
scaling saf production in a competitive market requires an expansion of the feedstock mix, and support from industry players to drive down prices. 2.
supply chain constraints such as labour shortages or scarcity of raw materials.
for example, the lack of scrap metals in asia for a less carbon-intensive process of steel production. 3.
the lack of government incentives to support the adoption of low-carbon solutions including electric vehicles and charging stations, which impede their affordability especially in emerging markets.
in our next phase, we will continue to refine our client engagement approach on climate mitigation to further evaluate the feasibility and robustness of their transition plans.
we will also continue to roll out innovative financing solutions, especially through new strategic ecosystem partnerships.
read more in the next section on "business opportunities".
enabling our relationship management teams to effectively engage clients our approach to steering portfolios towards net zero is driven by robust internal processes and digital tools: 1.
regular cadence with sector teams to monitor performance a central team of sustainable finance experts maintains active dialogue with sector coverage teams across all our core markets and where we have a sizeable international presence.
this ensures esg considerations and clients' decarbonisation plans are at the forefront of our relationship managers' malaysian ringgit minds.
to help teams stay abreast of industry developments, market trends, government legislations, and technological advancements, we invite knowledge partners, industry associations, or governance bodies to conduct learning sessions for our rms and credit risk managers crms. 2.
leverage esg risk questionnaire erq to engage clients we have progressively enhanced our erq, which guides rms to evaluate esg risks and opportunities consistently, forming the basis for more informed client engagements.
this enables the bank to gain clearer insights on our customers' risk management measures as well as financing and transition needs. 3.
actively manage portfolio with digital tools since establishing our net zero targets, we focused on developing tools to support our rms to understand our clients' position on climate change and forecast their future climate change performance using scenario analysis.
our climate analytics tool cat generates insights on the simulated emissions performance trends of a client over the short, medium and long-term.
this facilitates more in-depth and forward-looking conversations to guide our clients in operationalising their decarbonisation plans more effectively.
additionally, a portfolio management function helps industry and segment heads, as well as with senior leaders within the bank simulate how various factors could impact a sector's emissions performance.
this includes potential new businesses, loan rundowns, or changes in customer operating models.
the cat has been tailored for our priority sectors, covering power, oil & gas, real estate, steel, and aviation, with plans for the other sectors to be completed in 2024.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 17 industry and policy engagement engagement with industry and policymakers is one of the industry and policy matters through regular participation in committees, forums, and one-on-one meetings.
we seek to promote the development and adoption of policies, frameworks, and guidance that accelerate action on climate change both in the markets we operate in and globally.

i loans and trade financing with increasing momentum around the need to create positive environmental and social impact, our sustainable financing commitment, net of repayments, was around singapore dollar 70 billion as of december 2023.
up from around singapore dollar 51 billion from the previous year end.
to help accelerate clients‚Äô decarbonisation efforts, especially those in hard-to-abate sectors, it is critical that we provide financing for climate mitigation solutions.
in addition to financing green and renewable energy projects, enabling financing for the transition to lower carbon alternatives in hard-to-abate sectors is equally important to achieve a just and orderly transition.
case study 1: dbs structured the first sustainability-linked loan for global semiconductor company nexperia as the sole original mandated lead arranger, bookrunner and sustainability coordinator.

from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 financing infrastructure projects for climate adaptation climate adaptation measures are often assessed and embedded in infrastructure projects that we finance, including financings related to toll roads, sanitation, waste, and run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects, among others.
additionally, clients have started including climate adaptation plans in their construction designs.
selected clients that we have worked with are highlighted below.
dbs advised and co-developed psa singapore's green finance framework, which was launched in june 2023.
some of these green eligible projects include: - investments in the port infrastructure to make it adaptive to climate risks.
- adaptation to existing psa quays to protect against the threat of rising sea levels and manage flooding risks through more efficient drainage systems.

- measures to mitigate the urban heat island "uhi" effect through urban planning and building design optimised for shade and wind flow, and integrating urban greenery to reduce heat absorption.
| case study 5: the early retirement of a coal-fired power plant in indonesia, the first under asian development bank's energy transition mechanism energy transition mechanism - cirebon-1, a 660-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
in 2022, dbs was engaged as the sole financial advisor to the indonesia investment authority's ina energy transition mechanism energy transition mechanism, a pioneering initiative to achieve the early retirement of the 660mw cirebon-1 power plant and accelerate indonesia's energy transition.
dbs advised on various matters, such as debt and equity capital structuring, selection of international impact investors, market sounding for the debt, and structuring of the platform with pt sarana multi infrastruktur, among others, to better identify target projects and scale the energy transition mechanism programme.
the signing of a non-binding framework agreement between the asian development bank, pt perusahaan listrik negara, pt cirebon electric power and ina during the 28th conference of parties cop28 in december 2023 was a testament to dbs' advisory capability.
this partnership aligns with the indonesian government's sustainability goals to achieve significant emission reductions through a scalable model that can be applied to other integrated power players in indonesia and beyond.
under this advisory mandate, the power purchase agreement for the 660-megawatt cirebon-1 plant is slated to end around seven years earlier than scheduled. 2 a smart tariff is a type of energy tariff that varies depending on the time of day or the amount of energy used.
this means that consumers can save money by using energy at off-peak times, when demand is lower.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 19 ii bonds capital markets activity was muted in 2023.
despite this, dbs continued to maintain pole position in the singapore dollar bond markets, while also gaining market share across regional bond markets.
during the year, we facilitated close to singapore dollar 18 billion of esg bond issuances for our clients, most of which are in the form of green and sustainable bonds.
some of the notable esg bond transactions, where dbs was involved as an active bookrunner during the year, include the following: china power international limited in february 2023, dbs securities china limited - our securities joint venture in china - assisted china power with the issuance of a renminbi 800 million green bond, in the first green and technology innovation dual-labelled panda bond transaction, as sole lead manager.
in november 2023, dbs partnered china power in a renminbi 1.2 billion green panda bond issuance.
this also marked the first-ever onshore corporate green bond where net proceeds were used to support projects under the belt-and-road initiative.
capitalland integrated commercial trust cict dbs helped cict, one of the largest real estate investment trusts reits in singapore, issue its first singapore dollar-denominated green bond in june 2023, following a successful hong kong dollar-denominated green bonds issuance in march.
the issuances were made under cict‚Äôs green finance framework which dbs, as sole structuring advisor, helped to set up in 2022 to facilitate fundraising for the company‚Äôs green projects.
green singapore government securities sgs infrastructure bonds we continue to play our part to advance singapore‚Äôs national agenda on sustainable development.
we were re-appointed last year as joint bookrunner and sole retail coordinator for the reopening of the 50-year green sgs infrastructure bonds by the government of singapore.
a total of singapore dollar 2.8 billion additional issuance was successfully executed in this fundraising exercise, which continued to see strong demand and support from investors.
the proceeds from this issuance will be used to finance expenditures in support of the singapore green plan 2030, including the jurong region line and the cross island line.
forging new strategic partnerships besides the need for financing, companies also need to build their sustainability capabilities and capacity.
based on engagement with our clients, we understand that many companies that are just starting out on their sustainability journey may lack specific skillsets in areas such as measuring and monitoring carbon emissions, certifications, or sustainability disclosures.
having identified the common pain points our clients face, we have begun to establish and grow our ecosystem partnerships to address the key challenges faced by our clients and broaden our product offerings to support them on their sustainability journeys.
with our expanding network of partners, we are able to provide advice on decarbonisation solutions relevant to our customers‚Äô needs across industry sectors, provide financing to fund those solutions, and offer business-matching opportunities.
some notable partnerships we have established in 2023 include: h&m group dbs partnered with the apparel group to establish collaborative financing solutions to accelerate the necessary decarbonisation of fashion supply chains.
through the programme, suppliers get access to sustainable financing from dbs and technical support from sustainability consultant, guidehouse, to embark on factory upgrades to help them improve their energy efficiency.
unlike traditional banking solutions which seek to encourage such green activities indirectly, this programme provides direct funding with highly favourable terms to suppliers for specific greenhouse gas emission reduction activities, as approved by h&m group.
the first successful transaction was completed in 2023, with a manufacturer in india to fund capital expenditures to reduce their carbon emissions.
this partnership is the first-of-its-kind green loan programme in the apparel sector.
clp power in late 2022, dbs hong kong partnered clp power to provide smes with opportunities to invest in energy efficiency upgrade.
these opportunities were closely tied to clp power‚Äôs energy-as-a-service business.
the successful partnership was further expanded in june 2023, where we announced the launch of a new ‚Äúsme low-carbon rewards‚Äù programme.
this programme is tailored to further support hong kong smes in their transition to a low-carbon economy, while supporting the development of local renewable energy and promoting digital payment services adoption.
the partnership also enables more smes to tap into the energy saving services offered by clp to reduce operating expenses that would not be possible without.
the programme also offers banking service privileges to eligible sme customers who successfully setup auto-pay for clp bills with their dbs accounts, or through the setup of an electronic billing service directly with clp.
our dbs banking privileges on offer include preferential deposit rate and business account opening fee waiver, among others.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 20 risk management climate change continues to be an important systemic risk that has an impact across various key risk types, such as credit, reputation, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance.
building our climate and esg risk management capabilities and integrating climate risk considerations into our overall enterprise risk management processes continues to be a top priority.
strengthening second line role for esg at the start of 2023, the bank established a new esg credit risk team under risk management group along with a management position - head of esg credit risk - to provide leadership and expertise to further build our climate and esg risk management capabilities.
this new team presents an additional layer of review as illustrated in our enhanced esg risk assessment process, where they act as the second line of control after our sustainability and business teams.
enhancing esg risk assessment esg due diligence remains an integral part of our lending and capital market approval process.
it entails assessing and monitoring our customers in reference to our approach to responsible financing, our sector policies and corresponding sector guides, as well as evaluating their esg related risks.
these factors are aggregated to provide an overall esg risk score for our customer.
factors that contribute to higher esg risk scores may include significant climate risks physical or transition, inadequate esg governance processes, such as the lack of human rights and modern slavery policies, among others.
as depicted in figure 1, our enhanced esg risk assessment and customer-specific esg risk scores are embedded within our credit approval process.
where necessary, higher esg risk scores are escalated for enhanced due diligence and additional support from the institutional banking group ibg sustainability team first line and esg credit risk team second line may be required.
once these teams have established that sufficient esg risk mitigation is available, the credit application progresses along the credit approval chain.
however, in scenarios where the identified esg concerns are not sufficiently mitigated, or may present material credit and/or reputational risks to dbs, the credit application will be declined.
where warranted, this could lead to a further reassessment of the overall customer relationship.
defined by our internal control framework, our first line business teams and risk functions have clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the new esg risk assessment process.
our rms continue to act as the first line by conducting an esg risk assessment on the customer, supported by the sustainability team which reviews escalated transactions and recommends esg-related terms and conditions to mitigate such risks where necessary.
as part of the second line, the esg credit risk team further reviews customers with higher esg risk scores before transactions are submitted to and assessed by our crms.
group audit serves as the third line of control through periodic audit reviews on the effectiveness of esg risk management.
as one of our key enablers to continually deliver and operationalise our climate agenda, we prioritise reskilling and empowering our people on the subject matter.
for example, extensive training sessions are provided to rms and crms to enhance skillsets that will allow them to better assess the esg risks of our customers.
since inception in july 2023, dbs completed the enhanced esg risk assessments for over 7,000 customers, representing almost 60% of our total ibg lending exposure as of december 2023.
we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our esg risk assessment process and scoring methodology for our customers and further refine and update our approach based on emerging best practices.
reviewing our financing policies and standards to ensure our esg governance and processes are both robust and fit-for-purpose, we regularly review our financing policies and update relevant standards and policy documents.
our group responsible financing standard and group core credit risk policy are updated to ensure alignment between our climate strategy and our approaches to responsible financing and credit risk management.
sector guides, which provide a more structured approach to assess esg risks as part of our overall financing decisions, are also updated for our priority sectors, taking into consideration mandatory requirements and emerging best practices.
figure 1: an illustration of the process flow of our enhanced esg risk assessments within our credit approval process esg risk assessment process flow diagram notes: - this figure shows the new esg risk assessment process, with a second line review by the esg credit risk team.
- it includes key stages such as sector-level climate risk assessment, borrower-level climate risk assessment, non-climate esg risk assessment, and credit risk assessment.

the erq facilitates our data collection for customers' climate risk disclosures, and is used as a customer engagement tool to understand customers' transition plans, and explore financing and facilitation opportunities to support their transition to lower carbon businesses. 2.
responses obtained from the erq are combined with sector-level inputs from our climate stress testing exercise to provide an assessment of sector-level climate risk, individual borrower-level climate risk and other non-climate overall esg risk score for our customer.
factors that contribute to higher esg risk scores may include significant climate risks physical or transition, inadequate esg governance processes, such as the lack of human rights and modern slavery policies, among others. 3.
as depicted in figure 1, our enhanced esg risk assessment and customer-specific esg risk scores are embedded within our credit approval process.
where necessary, higher esg risk scores are escalated for enhanced due diligence and additional support from the institutional banking group ibg sustainability team first line and esg credit risk team second line may be required.
once these teams have established that sufficient esg risk mitigation is available, the credit application progresses along the credit approval chain.
however, in scenarios where the identified esg concerns are not sufficiently mitigated, or may present material credit and/or reputational risks to dbs, the credit application will be declined.
where warranted, this could lead to a further reassessment of the overall customer relationship. 4.
defined by our internal control framework, our first line business teams and risk functions have clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the new esg risk assessment process.
our rms continue to act as the first line by conducting an esg risk assessment on the customer, supported by the sustainability team which reviews escalated transactions and recommends esg-related terms and conditions to mitigate such risks where necessary.
as part of the second line, the esg credit risk team further reviews customers with higher esg risk scores before transactions are submitted to and assessed by our crms.
group audit serves as the third line of control through periodic audit reviews on the effectiveness of esg risk management. 5.
as one of our key enablers to continually deliver and operationalise our climate agenda, we prioritise reskilling and empowering our people on the subject matter.
for example, extensive training sessions are provided to rms and crms to enhance skillsets that will allow them to better assess the esg risks of our customers.
since inception in july 2023, dbs completed the enhanced esg risk assessments for over 7,000 customers, representing almost 60% of our total ibg lending exposure as of december 2023.
we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our esg risk assessment process and scoring methodology for our customers and further refine and update our approach based on emerging best practices. 6.
to ensure our esg governance and processes are both robust and fit-for-purpose, we regularly review our financing policies and update relevant standards and policy documents.
our group responsible financing standard and group core credit risk policy are updated to ensure alignment between our climate strategy and our approaches to responsible financing and credit risk management.
sector guides, which provide a more structured approach to assess esg risks as part of our overall financing decisions, are also updated for our priority sectors, taking into consideration mandatory requirements and emerging best practices.
no content was generated for page 21.
embedding human rights due diligence into our financing approach social considerations are a fundamental aspect of our overall esg risk assessment process.
among others, the following social related issues are considered in our financing decisions: 1 forced and child labour; 2 worker rights, including fair wages, reasonable working hours of training per employee, and working conditions, as well as freedom of association and collective bargaining; and 3 community rights, including cultural, land and resource related rights.
we conduct esg risk assessments as part of all new credit applications, annual credit reviews, or in the event there are negative esg news or reports regarding our customers.
our esg risk assessments are carried out using the erq, which was developed based on the profile of our institutional customer segments and referenced to our sector guides.
in 2023, we further enhanced the erq, which already covered social risks, to specifically assess our customers‚Äô human rights issues including forced labour, child labour practices and community rights.
we also enhanced a supporting document to provide rms and crms with more detailed guidance on assessing human rights risks.
these updates will be rolled-out in 2024.
as a signatory to the equator principles ep5, for in-scope project-related finance transactions, we apply the risk identification, assessment, management, and reporting requirements of the principles to eligible projects.
human rights requirements, such as environmental and social assessments, stakeholder engagement and the grievance mechanism are specifically outlined in principles 2, 5 and 6 respectively.
where a project has the potential to cause adverse human rights impacts, an assessment of such impacts shall be conducted.
we conduct our own internal review of project documentation during the due diligence and monitoring phases, and for higher risk projects an independent consultant will be appointed to conduct the due diligence process on behalf of the bank.
an action plan may also be negotiated with the borrower to address gaps identified and ensure compliance with the ep requirements.
in addition to environmental issues, critical human rights issues and the tracking of any required remediation are embedded in our due diligence and post-transaction monitoring.
read more about our reporting on the equator principles on page 36, and more about our approach to human rights due diligence on page 13.
establishing environmental and social incident management guide adverse environmental and social impacts that occur within our value chain pose a substantial risk to the bank and impacting the credit profile of our customers and the bank's reputation.
with rising awareness of environmental and social issues amongst our stakeholders and strengthening legal frameworks, we anticipate a corresponding rise in queries, complaints and legal action related to environmental and social issues in asia, as they have in other parts of the world.
in 2023 we developed an environmental and social e&s incident management guide.
the guide sets out a protocol for managing e&s incidents, complementing existing internal dbs controls.
an e&s incident is defined as an event with actual or potential adverse environmental or social impacts caused by dbs group‚Äôs operations, products or services.
it applies to all units, branches and subsidiaries within the dbs group.
the e&s incident management guide formalises our approach to e&s incidents, to maintain consistency across the bank and ensure timely and appropriate response.
stress testing and climate scenario analysis climate change has the potential to impact our customers‚Äô future creditworthiness, as well as the financial stability of the broader economy.
at dbs, we recognise the importance of climate scenario analysis to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as elucidate the potential implications of climate change for our strategy and business model over the short-, medium- and long-term.
one of our priorities under our climate strategy is to integrate climate considerations into our risk management processes to ensure the short, medium and long-term resiliency of our business.
in 2023, we further strengthened our climate and esg risk management capabilities through the development of a centralised data repository for more effective and efficient data and analytics.
our approach to climate scenario analysis includes: transition risk analysis is conducted using a suite of climate scenario analysis csa models.
the csa translates the effects of policy and regulation changes, technology development and changes in consumer preferences, as defined by a set of standard climate scenarios, into impact key financial drivers identified for each sector.
in 2023, we further refined our models to include the latest network for greening the financial system ngfs scenarios.
to date, we have conducted transition risk scenario analyses in our nine priority sectors selected based on their significance within the ibg portfolio and carbon emissions contribution.
these include power, oil & gas, automotive, aviation, shipping, real estate, steel, chemicals, as well as food & agribusiness.
looking ahead, we will continue to systematically deploy scenario analysis models to enhance our risk management processes.
physical risks analysis is conducted through forward-looking models that assess the physical effects of climate change on our clients‚Äô assets and operations over the short, medium and long-term, based on scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shared socioeconomic pathways ssps.
in our analysis, we consider: - acute risks resulting from increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, droughts and floods.
- chronic risks resulting from longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature, increased variability in weather patterns, or rise in sea levels.
in 2023, we enhanced geo-location data coverage for our portfolio and expanded our climate physical risk assessment to cover more hazards e.
grams., tropical cyclones, flooding, among others.
we also commenced a pilot study in the real estate sector to further refine our approach to assessing climate-related physical risk across our portfolios.
we are in the process of expanding the assessment of physical risk on other credit exposures within the nine priority sectors.
read more about our methodologies to climate scenario analysis modelling on page 105.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 23 summary of our climate scenario analysis in the real estate sector in 2023, we further expanded our pilot to assess the climate-related transition risks and physical risks in the real estate sector.
this sector was chosen for our pilot due to its materiality to the bank‚Äôs portfolio and the connection between transition risk and physical risk on this physical asset-based sector.
this pilot assessment allows us to gain a better understanding on data challenges, as well as obtain additional insights into our portfolio as we continue to enhance our methodology.
we aim to expand our assessment to other markets and sectors, as well as our collateral base.
we will also continue to invest in improving data gathering methods and data quality to better assess exposure to physical risk.
transition risk the sector comprises real estate operators, property developers and investment managers, and is characterized by its relatively low emissions intensity compared with other priority sectors during its operational phase.
it should be noted that emissions embodied in building materials could contribute considerably to climate change.
however, data availability continues to be a limitation.
based on the ngfs net zero scenario, climate transition risk to the real estate sector was assessed to be immaterial.
given the generally low emission intensities in all scopes of emissions as reported by our customers at baseline compared to other priority sectors, the proportion of carbon costs is likely to be relatively low as compared to the total operating costs, resulting in minimal financial impacts arising from climate transition risk.
physical risk physical risks can impact the financial strength of our borrowers through damage to property and disruption to operations.
we analysed our real estate portfolio with their underlying property assets to understand the potential impact our borrowers may face.
singapore initial insights show that there is minimal impact from coastal and fluvial flooding to our borrowers‚Äô portfolios, on a 2050 time horizon.
.
hong kong the analysis showed that most properties in our borrower‚Äôs properties will face minimal impact by tropical cyclones, with an immaterial exposure to borrowers with properties facing moderate physical risk by 2050.
.
we leveraged on data from an external data provider for the forward-looking hazard assessments based on future climate change scenarios; representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways, developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc.
we selected a high climate change scenario ssp6 - 5.5, which is the low mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions triple by 2075 and global average temperatures rise by 3.3 - 5.7¬∞c by 2100, over a 2050-time horizon.
we focused on the respective geographical locations that are material to our portfolio and the corresponding hazards as follow: a flooding coastal and fluvial for assets in singapore figure 2 b tropical cyclones for assets in hong kong figure 3 upskilling and empowering our people achieving our net zero targets and managing climate risks require continual upskilling and reskilling, especially for our frontline rms and second line crms.
since 2018, we have rolled out mandatory responsible finance e-learning training to all rms and crms to ensure alignment with our esg policies and standards.
newly hired rms and crms are assigned this training during onboarding, while a refresher training is assigned to existing colleagues every two years.
amongst rms and crms assigned to this mandatory training in 2023, 87% had completed the training as of october 2023 7.
we also held a series of green and sustainable trade financing trainings for rms to learn how to identify relevant opportunities and provide advisory and financial solutions to better support our customers.
parallel to establishing our net zero targets in 2022, we developed an inaugural climate-activation training that was progressively rolled out in the first half of 2023 over 1,800 rms and crms to empower them with the necessary climate-related knowledge to meaningfully engage customers in their decarbonisation and transition journeys.
in the latter half of 2023, we designed industry-specific clinic sessions to ensure our colleagues are able to apply the knowledge from the climate activation training effectively.
these sessions serve as a platform for our colleagues to delve deeper into climate-related concerns specific to their industry, utilise live cases for practical learning and explore effective approaches to engage customers. 6 shared socio-economic pathway ssps are climate change scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100 as defined by inter-governmental panel on climate change ipcc. 7 this refers to the number of employees assigned the responsible finance e-learning training within 2023 only.
please note that if employees are assigned the training towards the end of the year, they are not required to complete it till early part of the following year.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 24 metrics and targets net zero portfolio alignment to fulfil our commitment as a signatory to the nzba, we are committed to monitoring and reporting our progress against our sectoral targets annually.
in september 2022, we established two sets of targets.
the first set consists of seven scope 3 emissions reduction targets, while the second set is made up of two data coverage targets.
collectively, our commitment covers a total of nine priority sectors power, oil & gas o&g, automotive, aviation, shipping, steel, real estate, food & agribusiness f&a and chemicals.
altogether, these nine priority sectors are recognised as some of the most carbon-intensive sectors in the real economy and collectively account for a majority of global greenhouse gas emissions.
table 1 summarises the coverage of our priority sectors for our scope 3 financed emissions, reference scenarios and 2050 targets, while table 2 outlines our latest position for the reporting year 2023.
the summary of our decarbonisation performance on the right tracks the annual variance against the science-informed decarbonisation pathways we have chosen to guide us towards our interim 2036 targets and net zero 2050 targets for each of our priority sectors figure 4.
we have observed good emissions reduction progress in five out of seven sectors, and they track well against the relevant science-informed decarbonisation pathways.
however, we recognise that in very hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel almost on track and shipping not on track, there are dependencies and structural challenges that require long-term changes.
addressing these will often need broader ecosystem partnerships across the public and private sectors.
we remain committed to working with our clients and fostering partnerships to enable an economy-wide transition to net zero that is orderly and just.

as climate-related reporting practices are rapidly evolving, we acknowledge the need to revise our estimates and assumptions, which may lead to restatements.
in our annual stocktake of emissions performance to demonstrate our progression towards interim 2030 and 2050 net zero targets, we have utilised a range of data sources, reference scenarios and methodologies.
our reporting will align to best practices as data quality continues to improve and become more granular, while reference scenarios and methodologies are continually refined.
in our 2023 financed emissions update, we have not yet considered the pcaf guidance on facilitated emissions, as it was published in december 2023.
therefore, we maintained the methodology for ecm and dcm underwritings in this round of updates.
we calculated our attributable scope 3 financed emissions by taking the full amount that dbs underwrote for a period of one year after the issuance, which differs from the latest pcaf guidance of accounting for only one-third of the underwriting amount.

ceo message power the marginal increase in our recalculated 2022 emission intensity to 229 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours from 227 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours originally stems from this expansion of in-scope customers.
after the aforementioned expansion of in-scope customers, the final 2023 emissions intensity result shows a marginal increase to 234 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours from 229 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours in 2022.
this increase is a result of expanding the in-scope clients to include critical power and utility players that contribute to energy security within the apac region.
under the original methodology, the 2023 emissions intensity result for the power sector would have shown a decrease to 226 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours from 227 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours originally in 2022.
although the emissions intensity for the power sector increased marginally from 2022, we expanded our client coverage and product expertise within the renewables space as further elaborated on how we are managing our renewable energy portfolio on the right.
as a result, the overall performance for the power sector remains in a downward trajectory, with a decrease of approximately 10% since the baseline.
we are pleased to report that our 2023 financed emissions for the power sector remain significantly below the iea nze reference scenario of 378 kgco‚ÇÇ/ megawatt-hours for the same year.
decarbonising the power sector is critical for the global economy to achieve net zero by 2050.
at dbs, we are committed to decarbonising our power sector and achieving net zero by 2040.
we continue to help our clients chart their own pathways and make progress towards our interim 2030 targets.
highlights 2023 performance to further improve the coverage of our target, we expanded our in-scope customers in 2023 by adding a new category "integrated power producers".
with this new category, we further refined our methodology to more accurately reflect the nature of business for some of our customers, including those that were previously out of scope, such as customers categorised under transmission and distribution.
as vertically integrated power players are active throughout the entire electricity value chain, customers in this category typically generate higher emissions intensity compared to corporates that solely invest in power generation assets.
approach pillar 1: responsible banking the transition for the power sector depends not only on financial institutions but also on governmental policies and support, as well as technological advancements to improve commercial viability.
changes in legislation and policies would be required, including increased regional cooperation, to i drive more resources towards quicker deployment of low-carbon technologies and ii attract more capital from foreign investors and financial institutions.
dbs is also collaborating with the indonesia investment authority ina on their energy transition mechanism for the early retirement of thermal coal plants.
while we are already working on a potential pilot financing transaction, we recognise that the mpo of coal-fired power plants is still in its early stages in the market.
the scalability of such financing will take time, given multiple factors to consider and stakeholders to engage.
read more on how we are providing innovative financing solutions on page 19, and our approach to phase out thermal coal financing on page 22.
pillar 2: responsible business practices we continue to grow our renewable energy portfolio and phase out thermal coal financing.
dbs also recognises the importance of energy security in the region.
several asean countries have announced ambitious targets to reach carbon neutrality.
however, they continue to face challenges in deploying the capital required to build up grid infrastructure and scale up a stable supply of renewable energy.
as such, some countries may still need to rely on conventional power sources, such as gas, to provide a stable baseload supply of power and minimise any disruptions to economic activities.
by utilising our in-house developed analytics tools, we will be able to monitor and simulate potential emissions trends based on different economic and environmental scenarios.
this will help us to better understand our clients' needs and advise them on the various available transition and financing solutions that are suitable for their consideration.
the power sector's financed emissions reduction is on track to meet our 2030 target and has been performing below the iea nze reference scenario.
we are encouraged by the progress made to date, but there is still much work to be done to continue this trajectory.
we remain committed to supporting our clients in the power sector in their efforts to achieve net zero by 2040, which is crucial in decarbonising the other industry sectors to achieve net zero by 2050.
pillar 3: impact beyond banking managing our renewable energy portfolio our renewable energy financing increased from over singapore dollar 7 billion in 2022 to singapore dollar 10 billion in 2023.
this growth was driven by new loans granted to our key clients across the markets we operate in.
examples of our renewable energy financing activities include a first-of-its-kind solar project financing in bangladesh for a chinese-led consortium and advising and arranging the financing for a singaporean energy client acquiring renewable energy assets in vietnam.
our power sector's overall positive performance can be attributed to two factors: i our efforts to systematically support our clients as they build or acquire more renewable energy assets and ii our focus on advising and supporting our clients in their transition journey as they pivot towards low-carbon technology and solutions.
as part of our ongoing efforts to drive decarbonisation in the real economy, we are collaborating with various governmental agencies and power industry players to facilitate a just transition in the mpo of coal-fired power plants.
in line with our commitment set in 2018 to progressively phase out both thermal coal power and mining financing by 2039, our exposure to thermal coal in 2023 was singapore dollar 1.8 billion.
this represents a decrease from singapore dollar 2.2 billion in the previous year and singapore dollar 2.7 billion the year before.

oil & gas o&g 2023 performance the absolute financed emissions for our o&g sector decreased year-on-year and now stands at 26.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, reflecting a steady decline towards our interim 2030 and 2050 net zero targets.
our 2023 emissions also remain below the international energy agency‚Äôs iea net zero emissions by 2050 nze reference scenario for the same year.
during the year, our outstanding exposure to the entire in-scope o&g portfolio decreased by about 10%.
this decrease was attributed to several factors, including the intentional reduction of our overall exposure to o&g business activities, as well as lower drawdowns under existing committed facilities.
our financed emissions and methodological choices are also influenced by the availability of customer data and are subject to refinement when data quality improves17.
challenges and opportunities one of the key drivers to significantly accelerate the decarbonisation of the o&g sector and meet the 1.5¬∞c-aligned 2030 and 2050 net zero targets is to ensure substantial emissions reductions across the entire value chain scopes 1, 2 and 3 through the adoption of new energy and technologies.
consequently, many o&g companies are increasingly exploring and harnessing the potential of low-carbon fuel alternatives such as biofuels, green hydrogen, green ammonia and their related derivatives, and exploring the application of carbon capture, utilisation and storage ccus solutions to conventional fossil fuel-based processes.
however, widespread adoption of these alternatives remains limited today, partly due to the challenges of large-scale commercial adoption driven by factors such as affordability, feedstock availability and scalability issues, among others.
that said, dbs is committed to our goals to drive transition in our o&g portfolio.
we will continually and proactively engage our clients to explore low-carbon fuel alternatives solutions in our region, with the aim of developing innovative structuring solutions to enhance the bankability and scalability of such opportunities.
however, financial institutions cannot achieve this alone.
governmental policy support and intervention will play a critical role in the decarbonisation of the o&g sector.
read more about our industry & policy engagement on page 18 to accelerate our climate agenda. 17 as part of our ongoing data refinement process these improvements have led to a recalculation of our emissions for the previous year, 2022, from 35.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 28.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
pillar 1: responsible banking furthermore, we recognise the key limitations in the current approach in quantifying our absolute financed emissions for our o&g sector.
in line with the partnership for carbon accounting financials pcaf, the absolute financed emissions per client attributable to our o&g sector is calculated by dividing our financing to the client by the client‚Äôs company value and then multiplying by the client‚Äôs emissions: financed emissions = ‚àëcompany emissionsc x outstanding amountc / company valuec dbs, along with many other banks, uses this pcaf methodology to calculate absolute financed emissions.
as methodologies evolve, we will continue to review and reassess our approach accordingly.
pillar 2: responsible business practices pillar 3: impact beyond banking next steps our o&g sector‚Äôs absolute financed emissions are tracking well against our interim 2030 target.
while we are encouraged by the progress made to date, we remain cautious and mindful that much more needs to be done to continue this trajectory.
by utilising our in-house developed analytics tools, we will be able to monitor and simulate potential emissions trends based on different economic and environmental scenarios.
this will enable us to better understand our clients‚Äô needs and advise them on the various available transition and financing solutions suitable for their consideration.

for example, we financed the gigafactory of a key asian client into hungary in 2023 to support the european ev demand as well as the trade financing associated with the battery flows from china and korea to europe and the united states.
we expect to see such investments increase in our core markets, such as india and indonesia, where governments are announcing commitments to decarbonise the transport sector.
we believe that these efforts will have a positive impact on our financed emissions over time as more internal combustion engine ice vehicles are replaced.
as we progress towards our interim 2030 and net zero 2050 targets, the pace of electrification will be a key consideration that is dependent on several critical factors: - price parity of evs vs ices, which largely depends on battery pack prices; - accelerated rollout of more affordable ev models globally; - development of comprehensive charging infrastructure; and/or - government and policy support. 2023 performance our 2023 emissions intensity result for the automotive sector has improved to 0.111 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer, down from 0.117 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer in 2022.
it remains below the reference scenario of 0.114 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer 18.
this reduction in our portfolio emissions intensity can be attributed to increased financing activities across the electric vehicle ev value chain and efforts undertaken by our automotive clients in transitioning towards evs in response to growing demand themselves and the broader sector.
challenges and opportunities dbs continues to support the industry's transition to electrification by financing large gigafactories and cross-border trade flows across major markets.
for example, we financed the gigafactory of a key asian client into hungary in 2023 to support the european ev demand as well as the trade financing associated with the battery flows from china and korea to europe and the united states.

next steps geopolitics and industry-related factors could impact the pace of electrification in the short-term.
however, the longer-term direction for the automotive industry is towards an electrified future.
dbs remains committed to supporting our clients in their efforts towards a net zero pathway for themselves and the broader sector.
we will continue to engage with our top-emitting clients and support them in achieving decarbonisation by providing advisory services and financing for their pipeline of investments.
additionally, as we seek to further increase our financing across the ev value chain, we will also seek to engage with more clients to understand where they are on their net zero journey and what their financing needs may be. 18 in 2022, we increased the robustness of our emissions calculations for the automotive sector through methodology updates.
among these updates, the new european driving cycle nedc to worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp as the standard of measurement for emissions intensity.
the industry has recognised wltp as a more robust measurement with longer driving cycle which is closer to actual driving conditions.
as a result, emissions intensity measurements are generally higher under wltp compared to nedc.
using the wltp emissions intensity target.
nonetheless, we have opted to stay committed to achieving the target we initially set.
aviation airplane icon challenges and opportunities airlines remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with the majority of emissions in the aviation sector coming from fuel burned during flight.
to ensure that our portfolio is able to meet the iata fly net zero trajectory, our strategy includes supporting our clients‚Äô financing needs in their re-fleeting exercise and facilitating their adoption of sustainable aviation fuels saf.
however, these drivers for decarbonisation pose several challenges.
aircraft have a long useful life and can remain in service for 20 ‚Äì 30 years19.
fleet renewal to more efficient aircraft models could span many years even when newer aircraft models have been introduced.
this is compounded by the fact that aircraft have lengthy development times19.
for example, the time taken to research and develop a new aircraft model incorporating the latest technology and obtaining airworthiness certificates could take up to 10 years.
furthermore, limited supply and the high cost of saf often make it less economical for use by operators vis-√†-vis conventional jet fuel, resulting in lower quantity used compared to what the decarbonisation trajectory requires.
next steps we will continue to engage with our clients on their transition plans and support them through: - financing their re-fleeting to more fuel efficient aircraft; - facilitating the adoption of saf, including working with our clients and other stakeholders across the aviation value chain; - financing investments in novel aviation technologies, as they come to market likely post 2030; and/or - helping clients to access high-quality offsets for their residual emissions after other decarbonisation efforts are exhausted. 2023 performance our 2023 emissions intensity result for the aviation sector is 0.086 kgco‚ÇÇ/p-kilometer, a significant improvement from 0.152 kgco‚ÇÇ/p-kilometer in 2022.
our portfolio position is also within the reference scenario and is on track to meeting our interim 2030 target.
this performance was driven primarily by the increase in passenger load factor for airline clients from 2022 to 2023 as countries lifted travel restrictions and the demand for international air travel recovered almost back to pre-covid 2019 levels.

footnotes: 19 iata net zero roadmaps executive summary june 2023 shipping this was primarily due to additional drawdowns on facilities used to finance shuttle tankers.
these facilities were already committed before dbs set its sectoral decarbonisation targets, which were announced in september 2022.
notably, the shuttle tankers segment is disadvantaged regarding the computation of the ad due to the nature of their trade patterns and operational requirements, which consequently led to an outsized contribution to a higher alignment score.
if we exclude the shuttle tankers segment entirely, our shipping portfolio would align with the 50% co‚ÇÇ reduction trajectory.
challenges and opportunities shipping is a hard-to-abate sector.
the key decarbonisation drivers include: - higher vessel efficiency and - adoption of low-carbon fuels.
examples of low-carbon fuels, such as clean ammonia, clean hydrogen, clean methanol and biofuels, offer promising alternatives to existing maritime fuels.
however, there are trade-offs associated with each of these alternatives, and none has emerged as the clear dominant fuel for the sector going forward.
the higher cost of investments in more efficient ships and equipment, along with the uncertainties around the supply and cost of lower-carbon emitting fuels, are some of the ongoing challenges that ship owners face today.
in addition, the prevailing uncertainties relating to regulations, technologies, and passthrough of costs continue to undermine the pace of transition. 2023 performance the 2023 international maritime organisation imo greenhouse gas strategy20 on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships highlighted the increased ambitions to achieve net zero emissions from international shipping "by or around" 2050.
to this end, we will evaluate our financed emissions assessment parameters for our shipping sector against the new benchmark.
in 2023, we continue to report our performance against the poseidon principles trajectory that is aligned with the 2018 imo greenhouse gas strategy.
this, in turn, is based on a 50% reduction in emissions in 2050 compared to 2008 levels, which we refer to as the 50% co‚ÇÇ reduction trajectory.
the 2023 alignment delta ad of our shipping sector widened from the 50% co‚ÇÇ reduction trajectory, with a high alignment score of +15.6% compared to +5.4% in 2022. 20 2023 imo strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships next steps achieving decarbonisation in the shipping sector would require medium to longer-term strategies.
we will continue to engage with our clients on their transition journey and help facilitate the adoption of lower-carbon emitting technologies and fuels.
furthermore, we will need to direct our financing toward more efficient ships to improve our portfolio's alignment score.

steel 2023 performance in 2023, our emissions intensity result for the steel sector improved to 1.95 kgco2e/kilograms steel, compared to 1.99 kgco2e/kilograms steel in the previous year.
this is marginally above the reference scenario determined under the mission possible partnership's tech moratorium scenario 1.83 kgco2e/kilograms steel.
our 2023 performance has excluded upstream mining companies of iron ore and metallurgical coal from a financier's scope 3 emissions, which is in line with the sustainable steel principles ssp and practices of our peer banks.
if we had retained the original scope to include the upstream mining companies, our portfolio's financed emissions would have been 1.97 kgco2e/kilograms steel.
the actual pace of decarbonisation in the steel sector is slower than anticipated and we will need to strike a balance between honouring our existing commitments to clients and approaching our net zero goal.
nonetheless, improvements in the financed emissions of our steel sector can be attributed to our ongoing client engagement efforts.
these include financing the use of higher quality iron ores and fuel mix optimisation in their predominant bf-bof technologies, recycling scrap to produce secondary steel to gradually shift towards the relatively lower carbon-emitting eaf route, exploring the use of green hydrogen-based dri production and developing alternative technologies for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage ccus, among others.
in 2023, dbs has been increasingly focusing on extending sustainable financing such as transition and green loans to steel mills in taiwan and india.
we have also been providing sustainable trade facilities and structuring digital solutions for our steel clients to issue letters of credit to international council on mining and metals icmm members.
we believe these efforts will have a positive impact on the financed emissions of our steel sector over time as these get progressively reflected into our client's emissions data in the future.
challenges and opportunities the capital expenditure requirements in the steel industry are significant.
in particular, the long asset life makes it challenging to adopt more sustainable technologies and infrastructure in the short to medium term.
to achieve the goal of decarbonisation of the steel sector, it will have to rely heavily on electrification, which fundamentally requires a change in the way steel is produced, as well as a clean grid.
despite our steel portfolio being predominantly asia-centric, the more carbon-intensive bf-bof steel production technology remains dominant - reflecting the global steel production composition.
most of the production capacity is relatively new and not due for retirement anytime soon.
furthermore, government policies and regulations in asia to drive the eaf adoption lag behind those in more developed markets.
coupled with the structural shortage of scrap steel supply in asia, the shift from bf-bof to eaf has been hindered by the lack of transparency in the current pricing mechanism.
dbs will continue to incentivise our clients by extending sustainability-linked loans sll by setting specific targets/covenants to bring down the client's emission data.
we will continue to fine-tune our client selection criteria to focus on clients with lower carbon footprints and clearer roadmaps for decarbonisation.
next steps we are assessing the feasibility of adopting a regional reference scenario more suited to our clients' profile and host countries' status of economic development, compared to the global version used to date.

challenges and opportunities we continue to engage with property developers and real estate investment trusts reits to encourage the reduction of emissions and we have observed a notable improvement in their commitment and initiatives to accelerate the process of decarbonisation.
decarbonisation in the real estate sector is primarily dependent on the grid and driven by adopting the highest green certification standards, promoting renewable energy generation and utilisation, and implementing energy-efficient retrofits for buildings.
accessible, accurate and automated building energy data is fundamental for understanding energy performance in decarbonisation efforts.
scaling this across a complex mix of real estate portfolio and facilities across different regions poses a challenge, which can usually be overcome with the support and collaboration among governments, policymakers, and industry participants.
next steps we will continue to engage with our clients and support them in achieving decarbonisation by providing advisory services and financing for their pipeline of investments. 2023 performance in 2023, the overall portfolio performance of our clients by alignment delta^23 "ad" is -17.8% below the crrem reference scenarios, demonstrating a lower alignment score from -11.0% in 2022.
the improvement is attributed to more companies adopting greater energy efficiency measures for their buildings' operations and higher quality sustainability reporting that adheres to the elevated disclosure standards across the industry. 23 this alignment delta ad measures how our clients, constituents in sectors made up of varying asset types and activities, compared to a range of diverse underlying benchmarks.
real estate, made up of commercial, residential, hospitality and other assets, is an important sector in our institutional banking group ibg portfolio.
this ad method has allowed us to include a much wider range of property types and countries in our real estate targets than what other banks have announced thus far.

in 2023, data coverage for our f&a sector increased from 45% to 51%.
we are encouraged by this improvement and will continue to support clients who are in the earlier stages of measuring and reporting emissions.
challenges and opportunities tangible decarbonisation requires large-scale concerted efforts from all stakeholders across the value chains from primary growers, producers, processors, transporters and distributors to government and regulatory bodies.
approach there are currently limited supply-side decarbonisation levers that can significantly reduce emissions from the high high-emitting segments of the value chain at a commercially viable scale, while also meeting the growing demand for food.
moreover, addressing land-use change related emissions from farming is critical and requires government policy support to incentivise smallholder farmers to adopt environmentally friendly technologies.
on the demand side, shifting consumer behaviour towards more sustainable diets also requires time.
next steps while good progress is being made towards achieving our interim data coverage target, it remains challenging to set a single emissions reduction target for the entire f&a sector.
the sector is extremely diversified with emissions intensities varying materially across different agricultural produce and segments of the value chain.
while there have been recent developments in establishing decarbonisation pathways including the science based target initiative's forest, land, and agriculture flag guidance, such pathways have not yet been widely adopted by the industry and do not cover the entire f&a value chain.
we will keep abreast of industry developments and, in the absence of a single emissions target for the entire sector, will consider setting decarbonisation targets for material sub-sectors within f&a once an industry consensus on the applicable pathway emerges.
pillar 1: responsible banking managing our palm oil portfolio within our f&a portfolio, dbs continues to monitor the sustainability performance of our palm oil customers both existing and new to assess their alignment with our policies and standards, including our palm oil financing policy.
our palm oil customers include those who have either aligned with or have committed to working towards aligning themselves to the principles of no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation ndpe and/or the principles and criteria of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo.
we continue to engage our palm oil customers on addressing their sustainability challenges and support them by progressively making their supply chains more sustainable, addressing community rights and having better access to grievance mechanisms.
our rms also conduct site visits where possible to farms, plantations, local communities, and processing facilities that we finance.
where there are gaps identified in aligning with our standards, the sustainability team, alongside the malaysian ringgit and relevant credit teams will engage the customer to address them.
as of december 2023, our exposure to the palm oil sector was singapore dollar 1.1 billion 2022: singapore dollar 1 billion, representing no more than 0.2% of our total ibg exposure.
pillar 2: responsible business practices thematic capacity building for rms to keep abreast of industry developments as the agriculture, food, and other land use afolu sector evolves, we are continually upskilling and reskilling our rms, including the relevant topical trends and related regulatory requirements, among others.
for example, when the european deforestation-free regulation was rolled out in july 2023, we ran an internal training session for rms to stay abreast of its material business impacts for client engagement.
in the same year, we also organised a thematic workshop on sustainable protein transition that was conducted by industry practitioners to upskill our rms on industry developments.
pillar 3: impact beyond banking additional disclosures contents from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 34 chemicals data coverage % large corporate clients reporting emissions and physical output baseline: , 2022: , 2023: , 2030: baseline: 45%, 2022: 47%, 2023: 55%, 2030: 66% challenges and opportunities decarbonising the sector is challenging.
in the near term, improvements will largely be driven by enhancing process and resource efficiencies across the value chain, for example, by switching from coal to gas fuel for power.
in the longer term, nascent low-carbon technologies like green hydrogen and ccus can contribute to deeper greenhouse gas reductions when they are available at a commercial scale.
however, the applicability and impact of decarbonisation options will vary significantly across the wide spectrum of chemicals.
strong regulatory and economic frameworks will remain crucial for emissions reduction in the industry.
next steps the chemicals sector is extremely heterogeneous; companies often make a wide array of chemicals, each with different levels of emissions intensities depending on the process and use of the chemicals.
while good progress is being made towards achieving our interim data coverage target, available sector reference scenarios such as iea nze 2050 vary significantly in their starting points and trajectories due to varying inclusions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions and the types of chemicals.
hence, it remains difficult to set a single emissions reduction target for the entire chemicals sector.
we will keep abreast of industry developments and, in the absence of a single emissions target for the entire sector, will consider setting decarbonisation targets for material sub-sectors within chemicals once an industry consensus on the applicable pathway emerges. 2023 performance we remain focused on encouraging our corporate clients to quantify, monitor and report their emissions and physical output.
in 2023, data coverage for our chemicals sector increased from 47% to 55%.
we are encouraged by this improvement and will continue to support clients who are in the earlier stages of measuring and reporting emissions.

they also invested over four times more and were insured twice as much as non-users.
we also observed a strong interest in retirement planning with more than a two-fold increase in our customers setting retirement goals.
plan with digibank - save - protect - invest - retire well from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 38 ceo message besides enhancing plan on our digibank app, we also launched our open architecture dbs healthcare marketplace in 2023.
dbs healthcare marketplace is an aggregator site with comparator and filter functions so customers can conveniently and frictionlessly browse integrated shield plans and careshield life supplements across multiple providers, and take action to close their healthcare protection gaps to extend their hospitalisation coverage and long-term disability care costs.
the healthcare marketplace is being progressively updated to offer a wide variety of product solutions.
highlights - specifically designed to address the gaps in insurance available to caregivers of people suffering from dementia, we hope to offer some respite for caregivers as we move towards building a dementia-inclusive society.
- invest - to recalibrate investments for flexibility as part of the wider 'life stage investing' that we currently offer within our digibank app, we launched retirement portfolio in partnership with j.p.
morgan asset management to better preserve the wealth accumulated in the earlier stages of life.
one key feature, for example, includes the individualised retirement glidepath portfolio integrated into plan with digibank app.
here, customers can indicate their desired retirement age at the point of purchase, and the portfolio will automatically 'glide' from growth to stability as the customer approaches retirement.
- supporting sustainable and esg investing we are seeing increasing interest in investment products guided by esg principles, particularly amongst the next generation of clients, as awareness of sustainability issues increases and more clients seek to invest in ways compatible with their values.
as such, we are committed to assisting more clients in doing good while also doing well by enhancing sustainable and esg investment opportunities.
in december 2020, dbs private bank had targeted to have more than 50% of aum in sustainable investments1 by 2023, which we achieved by the end of 2021 and have maintained since.
in 2023, we updated our methodology to include all investment products, as we previously excluded products that did not have any esg ratings such as structured products, digital assets, among others.
under this new methodology, our sustainable investment aum against total investment aum was 55.6%2 as of december 2023.
in addition to integrating esg considerations into investment strategies for competitive returns, we are also providing opportunities for those who want to take an impact-first approach, an investment philosophy and approach that prioritises impact over financial returns.
looking ahead, we continue to strengthen our sustainable investment product suite and introduce new climate-themed products to our offerings for clients.
- availing products and solutions to all to strengthen financial resilience finally, to ensure as many financial product solutions as possible are priced within the reach of the median income households in singapore, we have both curated products, as well as collaborated extensively with strategic partners, offer high quality solutions at accessible price ranges in the wealth management space.
taking a principles-based approach, we have developed the following product solution suite at accessible price points to further strengthen financial resilience: - save - to build a strong financial foundation an example includes our regular savings plan, invest saver, where customers can automate their investments in low-cost exchange traded funds.
- protect - to address the rising healthcare costs we also developed, protectfirst, a micro insurance starting from singapore dollar 5 monthly that offers customers the benefit of protection in three areas - personal accident, critical illness and life.
an example includes the dementia caregiver protect which was launched in partnership with chubb insurance as a first-in-market insurance solution that provides support for dementia caregivers and care recipients.
- promoting retirement readiness amidst an aging society according to the ministry of health, singapore became an aged society in 2017 and is set to become a "super-aged" society, with one in four citizens aged 65 and above by 2026.
with an aging population, coupled with volatile economic cycles and various global trends, we recognise that retirement plans may be disrupted and there will be a need for recalibration.
to this end, there is mounting urgency for singapore's residents to plan ahead for financial adequacy in retirement, through personal savings and holdings in government schemes such as cpf life and their supplementary retirement scheme srs accounts.
in 2023, we kickstarted several initiatives and introduced a number of new products and tools to enable adequate financial planning for our customers amidst the imminent shift in the demographic transition.
in partnership with manulife, we ran a retirement campaign from may to september 2023, to better prepare our customers and their retirement plans.
the campaign aimed to raise awareness of the importance of planning ahead and emphasised how small, cumulative actions today can make a significant difference in financial adequacy during the later years.
we recognise that financial needs change over time, as such the composition of our investment portfolios should correspondingly evolve to reflect our changing circumstances, responsibilities, and future needs for our funds.
moreover, gaining a comprehensive and complete view of our financial health as we approach retirement can help identify and address any potential gaps early, as part of a more holistic financing planning journey.
- helping clients understand the climate-related impact of their portfolios for clients looking to understand the climate-related impact of their portfolio, we have partnered with msci to provide access to carbon-related datapoints, which is now internally available for our relationship managers to offer better advice on portfolio management.

financial inclusion democratising banking services for all our approach across asia, there remains a significant number of underbanked individuals and businesses.
access to affordable and appropriate financial services is crucial for addressing rising inequality, supporting livelihoods and enabling inclusive economic growth.
at dbs, we see an opportunity to meet these underserved needs through innovative financial services that make banking more inclusive and accessible.
we aim to democratise banking services by: - uplifting lives and livelihoods in our communities to expand our reach and provide financial access to serve the underbanked who are typically excluded from traditional banking services.
- boosting the playing field for micro, small and medium enterprises to proactively address working capital requirements and strengthen capacity building in sustainability through strategic partnerships.
- strengthening financial and digital support toward empowerment and self-reliance to further educate the community at large in making and executing better financial decisions while adopting good cyber hygiene practices online.
key initiatives uplifting lives and livelihoods in our communities lower-income and underprivileged families in singapore high inflation, elevated interest rates, and prolonged economic uncertainty globally are intensifying cost-of-living pressures.
this affects the overall financial health and wellness of many, especially the most vulnerable in society.
against this backdrop, helping our customers deal with the rising cost of living is of paramount importance to dbs, as we work ever more closely with governments, businesses and community groups in a collective effort.

work permit holders in singapore recognising that work permit holders wph, including migrant workers and migrant domestic workers, are among the most vulnerable residents in singapore, posb remains committed to onboard wph into the formal banking system.
we continue to be the only bank in singapore to do so, in collaboration with the ministry of manpower.
today, the bank holds over 70% market share of the overall wph accounts, and the number of accounts opened in 2023 have grown 18% year-on-year, mainly for the purpose of salary payment.
in our pursuit of strengthening the financial stability of wph, we delved deep into their digital banking journey, identified various obstacles and developed potential solutions that became foundational to our mission.
one of the key challenges was the apparent digital and financial literacy gap faced by many wph.
in response, the bank organised and rolled out several new and tailored initiatives during the year, which ranged from providing from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 40 priority sectors in india as part of our larger focus on responsible banking, our india franchise - dbs bank india limited dbil - has increased lending to specific sectors and categories of borrowers that are typically underserved when it comes to accessing formal credit.
with dedicated efforts in the past few years, dbil has been making a positive impact in the following areas: - agriculture - lending to farmers including women in rural india for allied agriculture activities and for improving sanitation.
- small business sector - lending to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises msmes - water sanitation and hygiene - lending to rural and semiurban locations the portfolio across these categories has reached singapore dollar 3 billion in 2023, an increase of about 30% over the previous year.
with the specific goal of empowering women in rural india, we embarked on our journey of on-lending to micro-finance institutions mfis in 2020.
these mfis provide targeted financing to women in the rural areas specialised in income-generation activities such as allied agriculture, handicrafts, small businesses, among others.
they also provide loans for the construction of toilets and piped water connections to improve sanitation and the quality of life and health in the remote rural hinterlands of india.
the mfi on-lending portfolio exceeded singapore dollar 400 million in december 2023, doubling the amount from the previous year.
to date, we have successfully supported about half a million women to achieve financial independence and their entrepreneurial aspirations.
case study 1: water sanitation & hygiene wash loans water sanitation and hygiene wash is a priority area for india and dbil aims to play a pivotal role in building the required capabilities and making sure that dedicated capital is available to finance this sector through our partner institutions.
to achieve this, we have entered into an agreement with water.org, a leading non-profit organisation, to support our partner micro finance institutions to develop financial products and also provide technical training for wash loans.
to date, dbil has partnered with seven such institutions with an overall disbursement of singapore dollar 8.7 million, supporting over 20,000 families.
durgƒÅ, a 45-year-old lady, lives in her village gokul nagar, aragataka along with her two sons and husband.
durgƒÅ came to know about wash loans offered by iifl samastha, one of the partner financial institutions of the bank.
she obtained a loan of singapore dollar 400 to construct a toilet with piped water connection which, as an exception to the norm, was not dependent on any governmental welfare scheme.
referring to her new toilet, durgƒÅ says, "my family has immensely benefitted from the access to clean water and toilet; it has also supported me in my dairy business".
taking inspiration from her, other homes in her community are also looking to leverage these wash loans to improve their water sanitation and hygiene.
highlights - we tailored our digital literacy training offerings to cater to the different needs of wph.
for example, to break down the language barrier and ensure more effective communications, we developed instructional videos with more animated elements and provided native-language voiceovers.
to further encourage active participation and build more self-confidence, the training workshops are modified to bring about a more immersive and interactive experience.
- in collaboration with the migrant workers' centre, we launched the inaugural 'midigi ambassador programme', an initiative to help migrant workers overcome language barriers in picking up digital skills.
as of december 2023, around 30 migrant workers have signed up to become digital ambassadors through this programme.
they are trained to offer enhanced support to their peers in dormitories or workplaces, fostering a stronger sense of community.
- we also rolled out a bi-monthly dedicated help desk at one of the key recreation centres for migrant workers, the terusan recreation centre, to provide additional banking assistance beyond our normal banking hours of training per employee.
besides enhancing digital literacy, we have also organised events and outings for our wph to places that are special and unique in singapore, such as the national art gallery and dbs sailboat rides.
we strongly believe these initiatives help foster a stronger sense of belonging and enjoyment within our community and underscore our dedication to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of the diverse communities we serve.

case study 2: reliance industries limited and dbs bank india collaborate to promote compressed biogas cbg project india produces a significant amount of agricultural residue which is usually burnt in the absence of adequate processing infrastructure and logistical support.
the agriculturally residue supply chain in india has traditionally been unorganised as farmers and aggregators have not been adequately incentivised and financed.
compressed biogas cbg, a purified compressed bio-gas that has similar calorific value and other properties to compressed natural gas cng, is carbon neutral and increasingly being utilised as a green renewable automotive fuel.
in addition to being an alternative fuel that could align with the global shift towards cleaner energy product while meeting the growing domestic demand for gas, cbg also benefits the local agricultural economy of india.
in particular, the production of cbg can provide farmers with an additional revenue stream and help them avoid heavy penalties linked to the burning of their agricultural wastes.
reliance industries limited 'reliance', identifying this as an important element in their net zero road map, has planned to invest across the country to produce cbg as an alternative to imported cng and other fossil fuels making india a prominent source of bio-fuel.
in 2023, dbs collaborated with reliance to develop a supply chain financing programme in this regard.
the cbg industry is highly fragmented in nature and predominantly dependent on agriculture that is affected by seasonal variations.
these modalities required dbs bank india to introduce significant customisations to the standard supply chain financing model to meet the requirements of the project.
the financing provided by dbs enabled the development of the ecosystem for vendor partners to aggregate agricultural residue as inputs for cbg production plants across india.
the funding structure also ensured that the logistics are designed in a way that the cbg project could remain competitive and achieve enhanced commercial scale.
reliance plans to set up around 100 cbg plants over the next 5 years that would consume more than 5.5 million total weight of recycled waste, including electronic waste per annum of agricultural residue and organic waste, resulting in an estimated reduction of about 2 million total weight of recycled waste, including electronic waste of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
soumya dutta, head of treasury, reliance industries limited said, ‚Äúas a company, reliance industries has accelerated plans to deploy bioenergy projects and we are proud to have dbs bank india partner with us in our larger goal of sustainable development and in the clean energy transition of our nation.
dbs bank is renowned for its expertise in supply chain financing and goes beyond traditional banking to enable responsible solutions for large enterprises, their supplier networks as well as small and medium businesses by empowering them to streamline operations for enhanced efficiency.
the bank's extensive asian network and deep expertise in customising sustainable solutions enable businesses to mitigate risks and seize growth opportunities.‚Äù boosting the level playing field for micro, small, and medium enterprises msmes addressing working capital requirements among msmes the post-pandemic era has been significantly more challenging than most had initially hoped.
heightened geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, the energy complex causing a spike in inflation, and extreme weather events are just among the many global challenges experienced in the past year.
despite being the backbone of many economies, msmes often face the brunt of such turbulence.
as msmes pivot in a post-pandemic era, they continue to have unmet working capital requirements to sustain themselves.
in 2023, we have approved over 4,400 unsecured loans totalling singapore dollar 665 million to msmes in singapore, which consisted of both government risk share and commercial unsecured loans.
dbs has also doubled down on efforts in addressing the unmet working capital requirements of our sme customers in our core markets across asia.
for example, dbs hk is an active lender to the hk sme financing scheme, which was jointly launched by the hong kong government and hkmc insurance, to enhance cashflow support for local smes and help them obtain financing for their business needs.
in india, dbil launched an exclusive outreach programme for empowering smes through knowledge sharing and focused events targeted at financing smes.
building strategic and sustainability capabilities through partnerships besides addressing the limited access to financing, the feedback from many smes is that they are seeking support to strengthen internal capabilities, as well as opportunities to collaborate and establish stronger partnerships.
dbs remains committed to focus on supporting sme owners to build capabilities, upskill their employees and empower them on their sustainability journey.
in 2023, the programme pivoted to focus on sustainability, with the aim to boost sustainability capability and capacity in smes, in response to the growing interest amongst our sme customers to embrace sustainability as part of their business strategy.
taking a holistic approach to strengthen overall business resilience, the programme offers support in areas of business growth, banking and finance, digital transformation and cyber wellness.

the tool enables businesses to review and evaluate their sustainability efforts and recommend actions for progress across their approach to governance, strategy, risk management, and setting meaningful metrics and targets.
to help smes kickstart their decarbonisation journey, we are partnering with several carbon management platform providers to offer simplified online platforms for smes to input and assess their direct carbon emission and datasets.
more initiatives under the track better pillar will be progressively rolled out from 2024 as we continue to accelerate the sustainability journeys of our sme customers.
strengthening financial and digital support towards empowerment and self-reliance young people dbs has been promoting the importance of savings and encouraging the habit of being thrifty among young singaporeans for generations.
one of the ways we have been doing so is through the posb smart buddy programme, which was launched in 2017 as the world‚Äôs first integrated in-school savings and payments programme.

highlights seniors and elderly to forge a more inclusive digital society, dbs/posb has been providing financial and digital literacy training to the less-digitally savvy, including seniors who have had to grapple with the increasing prevalence of digital platforms in our everyday life.
we believe they will have more confidence and resilience to adapt and navigate the rapidly digitalising world when they are equipped with the right digital skills and know-how.
to ensure that no one is left behind in singapore‚Äôs digitalisation journey, in partnership with dbs foundation and the singapore digital office we committed singapore dollar 1 million in november 2022 to support the national digital for life dfl movement.
this broad-based support will benefit close to 100,000 singaporeans through grants for digital inclusion projects, and digital banking and payments workshops over the next two years.
in 2023, we pioneered a new series of edutainment roadshows, incorporating digital literacy workshops infused with elements of getai ‚Äì a form of vernacular entertainment involving live performances of music, song, and dance ‚Äì to better attract and engage our seniors.
with the growing threat of online phishing scams in recent times, we believe a strong digital literacy is imperative.
we recognise that seniors are more likely to need help when it comes to adopting safe cyber security practices.
to this end, we partnered with the cyber security agency of singapore csa ‚Äì in collaboration with the singapore police force spf and infocomm media development authority imda ‚Äì and co-developed an anti-scam and cyber security quiz under the sg cyber safe seniors programme.
in 2023, we engaged over 16,800 seniors who participated in our digital literacy workshops, including the imda digital payment learning journeys where anti scam security tips make up the foundational training before embarking on the cashless learning journeys.

we continue to advance our sustainability agenda through a proactive and multifaceted approach that focuses on minimising negative environmental impact rather than relying on reactive measures like purchasing offsets.
by adopting a life-cycle perspective, we strive to identify and address environmental challenges at every stage of our operations.
to address our carbon, energy, water and waste footprint, we have developed a four-lever approach to systematically drive progress based on prioritising our efforts in the following order: - lever 1: reduce consumption of resources - lever 2: generate renewable energy - lever 3: purchase green products and energy - lever 4: purchase renewable energy certificates recs and carbon offsets note on data quality and coverage to improve our data quality, we are continually enhancing our data governance, systems, and processes.
this includes conducting internal quarterly data reviews and exploring new technology to enhance data collection, management, and visualisation.
across our locations, our operational environmental data is collated from different sources, including metered data, utility bills, and landlord statements, amongst others.
improving the reliability of data, particularly from third party vendors, is an area we are focused on continuously improving.
all operational environmental data disclosures in this report is subject to rigorous internal checking and review, with selected indicators also subject to external assurance as detailed on pages 97 to 101.
in 2023, dbs completed the acquisition of citigroup inc.'s consumer banking business in taiwan citi consumer taiwan.
however, the integration of citi consumer taiwan's environmental data is still underway and is therefore excluded from the scope of our reporting on operational environmental footprint.
key initiatives reducing consumption of resources our first priority is to reduce resource consumption and increase operational efficiency in our operations e.
grams., office buildings, bank branches, energy systems, etc..
energy reduction and management approach we reduce our energy consumption through a series of operational energy reduction and efficiency initiatives.
in 2023, we successfully converted four branches in india to operate at a net-zero-energy level, namely, t nagar, dindigul branch premises, vashi and nagapatinam branches.
we have designed net-zero-energy retrofits for these and other offices in our portfolio, and we are assessing implementation of these retrofits.
we also consistently install occupancy sensors for lights and cooling in all new spaces whenever feasible, in line with our principle of using energy only where necessary.
at present, over 80% of our manned retail branches in singapore are certified green buildings.
in 2023, our operational energy consumption was 121,357 megawatt-hours and our carbon emissions were 53,446 measures carbon dioxide equivalent emissions across various operational scopes.
while this marks an increase from the previous year, we have continued to neutralise our carbon footprint through investing in high-quality carbon offset projects that are independently verified and certified.
while offsetting, our strategy remains to prioritise efforts that improve energy efficiency, increase the production and use of renewables, and implementing sustainable practices across our operations to minimise our footprint.
read more about our approach to carbon offsetting on page 62.
green mark platinum certification for over 80% of our manned retail bank branches since 2017, we have been pursuing opportunities to redesign our branches to be more resource-efficient and carbon-light by: - integrating intelligent occupancy-based lighting and air-conditioning systems to minimise energy consumption.
- implementing water-efficient fittings and dedicated meters to minimise and monitor water consumption.
- introducing green features and innovation such as video teller machines that are equipped with energy-saving light dimmers and sensor controls to enhance efficiency and customer service.
we will continue to integrate environmentally conscious practices at every level as much as possible such as supply chain sustainability, waste reduction and management initiatives through materials and fittings used in the design of the space.
in 2023, 33 out of the bank's 41 manned branches were certified green mark platinum which is a pinnacle rating under singapore's building and construction authority bca green mark, an internationally recognised green building certification scheme.
our target is to have 100% of our branches certified green mark platinum in singapore by the end of 2024.

waste reduction and management approach11418 we track and divert waste from landfills and incinerators in addition to managing waste at the source through managed procurement.
in 2023, we started regular waste audits in primary food service areas as well as our pantry areas.
we also installed ai based recycling-help-systems and monitors in several areas to test the efficacy of machine-based behaviour feedback for waste and recycling.
we continue to implement ewaste tracking across all markets, and ewaste collection points for employees in several markets.
in our dah cafeteria, an ai-food waste tracking and reduction system is being deployed to record how and what foods are being wasted through smart meter technology attached to food waste bins.
this real-time data is used to analyse trends and better anticipate production quantity in a bid to decrease overall waste.

sustainable transport aimed to reduce emissions from our employee transportation services by converting to more sustainable modes of transportation.
dbs tech india dti in 2023, dti progressively switched from cabs to buses throughout the year.
in total, 108 cabs were removed while 22 buses were added to the fleets.
as a result, total fuel consumption from the conversion dropped by 63% from 55,112 l to 20,358 l as well as a reduction in total distance travelled from 673,000 kilometer to 61,000 kilometer thereby reducing fuel consumption too.
dbs newton green dng in line with our commitment towards net zero operations, we introduced an electric shuttle bus at dng in august 2023.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 63 sustainable procurement managing our supply chain sustainably our approach as a leading financial services group in asia, we purchase a diverse range of products and services, including professional, software, real estate, and corporate services.
guided by our vision to be the best bank for a better world, we integrate environmental and social considerations into our procurement decision-making, alongside financial factors.
our procurement activities are managed in accordance with our formal policies and processes: group procurement policy: , group procurement sourcing guide: group procurement policy: outlines our strategy for the purchasing of goods and services to meet dbs' requirements while minimising risks and maximising value, group procurement sourcing guide: supplements the group procurement policy and standard documents group procurement standard: , sustainable sourcing principles ssp: group procurement standard: extends throughout the procurement cycle, from identification and specification of requirements to the awarding of contracts to suppliers, sustainable sourcing principles ssp: outlines the expectations we have of our suppliers in upholding health and safety, environmental sustainability, business integrity and ethics, as well as in complying with dbs human rights policy our supply chain management programme includes: accelerating a restorative enterprise to grow restorative procurement together with our ecosystem partners adopting a risk management approach to utilise a comprehensive set of processes and tools in investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain to ensure a diverse and efficient supply base that is continually supported through supplier engagement and training key initiatives accelerating a restorative enterprise since 2021, the restorative procurement framework "framework" has guided our partnerships with suppliers, as we work towards building a restorative enterprise.
the framework brings together various sustainability aspects ‚Äì circularity, carbon, biodiversity, and the broader social agenda.
we integrate these restorative principles directly into our procurement processes, including our ssp and approach to screening, prioritising, assessing and engaging our suppliers.
this promotes not only "doing less harm" but also "doing more good" across our supply chain.
keep earth‚Äôs resources in use for as long as possible through 11 levers: materials: post-consumer, renewable materials and energy production: circular process, re-manufacturing distribution: everything-as-a-service, re-sell usage: sharing platforms.
disposal: recycling, reverse logistics figure 1: an illustrative framework of how dbs conducts restorative procurement restorative approach in action during the recent closure of multiple premises in indonesia due to branch relocations or mergers, we successfully collected over 100 pieces of security equipment, including cctv cameras and keypad readers.
instead of discarding these items, we adopted a restorative approach by reusing them as replacements for damaged items in existing branches.
this not only reduced use of resources, but also resulted in cost savings of over singapore dollar 10,000.

we utilise a comprehensive set of processes and tools in an iterative manner to govern our supplier base, which consists of thousands of regional suppliers across diverse spend categories.
screening: this year, as part of a pilot programme, we have introduced additional esg parameters to the sustainability criteria embedded within our supplier evaluation metrics.
this enhancement enables us to evaluate suppliers on their commitment to internationally recognised responsible and sustainable business practices, including specific factors such as environmental and workplace health and safety standards, project specific carbon footprint, employee diversity and development metrics and supply chain governance.
to enhance objectivity, fairness and transparency within the sustainability criteria during supplier evaluations, we have also crafted the criteria to be more quantifiable and verifiable.
this reduces the risks of subjective interpretation.
we have rolled this out through a pilot programme, which specifically targets higher risk category items with higher value contracts.
this pilot programme allows us to test and refine the effectiveness of the expanded sustainability criteria within a focused scope, prior to its official implementation.
we also continued to employ our ssp as the primary screening mechanism for all new suppliers as part of the onboarding process.
in 2023, we successfully onboarded close to 800 suppliers across our core markets, with more than 99% of new suppliers aligned with our enhanced ssp.
going forward, onboarded suppliers who do not commit to align with the ssp will be enrolled into our sustainability ratings exercise, which will help us to mitigate any potential risks and monitor the sustainability performance of these suppliers.
uplifting our sustainable sourcing principles as part of our ongoing uplift of our ssp, we made significant strides to further promote the principles of restorative procurement amongst our suppliers.
we require suppliers to implement appropriate programmes or policies to manage their environmental impact.
we have also added a clause to encourage suppliers to go beyond doing less harm and adopt restorative approaches that create a net zero or net positive impact on the environment and society.
to address human rights, we have incorporated enhancements to secure commitments from our suppliers for the equitable remuneration and health and safety of workers, and the well-being of local communities.
additionally, we emphasise our requirement for suppliers to take appropriate measures to remediate any adverse human rights and environmental impacts that may result from their products or services.
this commitment extends further to include a grievance mechanism for addressing and resolving any human rights impacts that may arise in our supply chain.
these enhancements underscore our dedication to advancing sustainability and ethical business practices within our procurement processes.
we encourage our suppliers to actively share dbs‚Äô ssp with their next-tier suppliers and business partners to create a broader impact and foster alignment with responsible practices throughout the supply chain.
as part of our supplier engagement initiatives, we actively work to enhance the capabilities of our suppliers and fortify our partnerships to build a restorative enterprise.
in our recent sustainability workshops for suppliers, we underscored the significance of our ssp, highlighted forthcoming modifications, and offered our suppliers the chance to seek clarifications.
this proactive approach prepares suppliers for upcoming enhancements and fosters more collaborative partnerships.
read more about how we are embedding human rights due diligence in our procurement practices on the next page.
prioritise and assess: with thousands of suppliers in our supply base, we need to prioritise and focus our attention on the most important areas.
we do this by taking a risk-based approach to our supplier segmentation analysis.
we derive suppliers‚Äô risk levels based on our aggregate spending with the suppliers, suppliers‚Äô country of operations and the category of goods and services provided by the supplier.
since 2022, we have partnered with a global sustainability ratings provider, ecovadis, to assess high risk suppliers.
suppliers are evaluated based on their commitments to environment, labour and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement.
evaluated suppliers receive a scorecard detailing an appropriate corrective action plan and areas for improvement.
as a recognition of their efforts, dbs has extended the acknowledgement period for suppliers achieving a silver, gold, or platinum ecovadis medal beyond the standard one-year validity stipulated by ecovadis.
our network on the ecovadis platform now consists of over 200 dbs suppliers scorecards adhering to the validity period defined by dbs.
by expanding our supplier network on the platform, we enhance transparency in our supply chain sustainability performance.
this supports our commitment to fostering a responsible and resilient business ecosystem.
pillars to our sustainable sourcing principles sustainable supply chain screen, prioritise, assess, engage sustainable sourcing principles ssp supplier segmentation sustainability risk materiality categories scope 3 supply chain emissions supplier ratings supplier excellence awards training & development supplier day notes: this document provides an overview of dbs' approach to governance of sustainability in their supply chain.
the document highlights key initiatives, programmes and partnerships, including a pilot program for esg parameter evaluation and a partnership with ecovadis for supplier assessment.
embedding human rights due diligence in our procurement practices we are committed to doing business with respect for human rights through our sustainable procurement practices.
our first line of defence is the requirement for all new suppliers to be screened by our ssp.
as part of ssp uplift mentioned on page 65, we have incorporated enhancements to the human rights clauses within the principles by drawing on standards and guidance set by leading international frameworks, including those established by the united nations un and the international labour organization ilo.
specifically, our enhanced ssp require that suppliers: - champion human rights by prohibiting human trafficking, slavery, harassment and abuse - prohibit child labour - promote diversity and inclusion - protect the health and safety of workers - uphold fair and equitable remuneration of workers engage: we view engagement as an integral part of our ongoing collaboration with suppliers.
as part of our engagement strategy, we aim to support and work with our suppliers to improve their sustainability performance.
in 2023, we issued corrective action plans to eight suppliers falling within ecovadis' lowest sustainability performance level.
additionally, we actively seek to improve the sustainability of our supply chain by enrolling suppliers who are assessed as high risk to participate in our sustainability training workshops.
investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain in 2023, we held a sustainability training workshop on restorative procurement, covering essential topics such as circular procurement, life cycle analysis, dbs' sustainability approach as well as addressing the upcoming revisions to our ssp and sustainability evaluation criteria.
with participation from over 25 suppliers and 70 dbs employees from group procurement services, including sourcing managers, this training workshop highlighted our commitment to promoting sustainability across our supply chain.
moving ahead, we will continue our approach of engaging and training suppliers to adapt to the market's evolving sustainability requirements.
this remains key for us in managing potential risks and improving the overall transparency of our supply chain.
pillar 1 responsible banking - respect employees' rights to associate freely and collective bargaining - act ethically, prohibit bribery, corruption, practice transparency and accountability we also emphasise the requirement for suppliers to take appropriate measures to remediate any adverse human rights impacts that may result from their products or services.
as a second layer of defence, we continue to perform annual supplier assessments on suppliers identified as high risk, through our partner ecovadis, on multiple aspects including human rights, labour practices, and ethics.
as part of our supplier engagement initiatives, we actively work to enhance the capabilities of our suppliers on sustainability matters.
read more on our approach to screening, prioritising, assessing and engaging suppliers on page 65, and about our overall approach to human rights at dbs on page 13.
pillar 2 responsible business practices to protect us against supply chain disruptions amidst uncertainties from geopolitical and economic situations, in 2022 we established a hardware resiliency framework to drive visibility, agility and resilience in supply chain processes.
through this framework, we focus on proactively engaging key vendors to gain insights into their delivery lead times and supply risk mitigation strategies.
this enables us to better detect any potential risks of delivery delays and work with our stakeholders to source for alternate solutions.
in addition, we also continue to improve our processes to meet market standards and ensure adherence to our delivery commitments.
we are committed to continuously update the framework based on evolving vendor structures and relationships influenced by globalisation.
this comprehensive approach underscores our dedication to maintaining operational excellence and delivering exceptional service to our customers.
pillar 3 impact beyond banking notes: this image contains an image placeholder, representing a visual element or a chart from the original report.
technology resilience including cyber security fortifying resilience and security our approach technology is critical to our business strategy and processes.
it enables a seamless banking experience for our customers and is at the heart of our strategy to drive growth.
however, the growing complexity of our technology stack and network infrastructure, coupled with rising cyber threats, present a growing risk for our business.
in 2023, the occurrence of digital disruptions that interrupted our service served as a catalyst for further enhancing our resilience.
to improve service reliability and ensure the resiliency of our technology infrastructure, we embarked on a comprehensive roadmap in may 2023 through the technology risk management uplift programme t-up which is chaired by the ceo.
this roadmap will culminate in improved service availability and reliability.
in addition, dbs remains resolute in our commitment to fortify our cyber security capabilities against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, ensuring the delivery of safe and secure banking services to our customers.
the ongoing targeting of our customer base by cyber threat actors who employ sophisticated tactics like social engineering, phishing scams, and mobile malware, coupled with the escalating risk of cyberattacks on our online banking services and technology infrastructure amid geopolitical tensions, underscores the imperative for us to continue to invest in and explore the latest advancements in cyber security technologies.
in light of this, we are not only building security and resiliency into the architecture, design and deployment of technology, but we are also building it into our culture, ensuring this is factored into every decision we make.
through t-up, we are improving and tightening our processes in: - change management - system resilience - incident management - technology risk governance we also continue to maintain robust cyber security governance and approaches to ensure overall technology resilience.
key initiatives change management dbs has a microservices architecture, which is supported together via a number of third-party systems.
while this is the preferred architecture for most modern technology companies, the one challenge it poses is that a bug in one part of the ecosystem could result in previously unknown problems elsewhere.
this underscores the importance of active-active configurations.
additionally, some of our services are delivered through common/ shared systems, which can potentially result in single points of failure.
to prevent this, we are decoupling these shared systems at both the front and back ends so that key services are always available on at least one channel.
this will be completed by q1 2024.
to complement our engagement with vendors, we have established 10 centres of excellence coes that house expertise across different domains.
the coes will drive standardisation of architecture and reuse of assets, uphold quality service delivery, and develop competency for shared application and services.
our mobile applications have been enhanced to detect and remove the presence of malware.
our cyber security control environment is regularly tested and attained the highest tier of preparedness for the cyber trust mark.
system resilience we recognise that customers expect to have access to key services such as balance enquiry and digital payments in an uninterrupted manner.
to ensure that these services have minimal downtime, for critical applications, we have now built a hot standby capability to supplement existing active configurations.

technology risk governance to strengthen technology risk governance and oversight, effective 1 november 2023, the bank formed a new sub-committee of the board risk management committee brmc called the brmc technology risk committee.
the bank also transferred the technology risk management team to the risk management group, reporting to the chief risk officer, to enhance independent checks and balances.
we also bolstered our site reliability engineering team with new leadership and established a dedicated quality assurance function, the latter which serves as an independent layer of checks on change management within group technology.
cyber security cyber security remains a cornerstone of our technology resilience approach as we continue to digitalise our business and operations.
we continue to achieve external verifications and certifications that underscore our dedication to maintaining high standards of information security.
this underscores a comprehensive approach to establishing and maintaining effective information security practices and technology management.
some of our 2023 highlights are: - achieved iso27001 certification for information security management systems - achieved singapore cyber trust mark ctm certification at the advocate level - our robust data protection policies and practices are also certified by t√ºv s√ºd, an external independent certification body in 2023, we continued to improve our cyber security capabilities through: investing in our cyber defence capabilities we enhanced our cyber defence capabilities through the following: - enhanced and secured our mobile applications using solutions such as runtime application self-protection rasp, ensuring a continued safe banking experience for customers.
the enhanced control detects the presence of malware, prevents unauthorised access on compromised devices, and guides dbs customers to remove malicious mobile applications.
strengthening cyber incident response in addition to investing in cyber security controls, we equally prioritise the development of robust cyber incident response and recovery capabilities.
in 2023, we: - implemented deep packet inspection of our web traffic to detect and prevent sophisticated and evasive cyber-attack tactics and techniques.
approach - implemented secure file transfer technologies to facilitate secure collaboration with external parties, and established secure storage of sensitive data for our developers.
- reviewed our key cyber security technology stack to identify opportunities for improvement, ensuring alignment with the evolving cyber threat landscape.
this led to the refreshment of our: - web isolation to enhance our network's resilience against sophisticated web-borne threats.
- data protection controls to strengthen overall data protection framework and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- application security testing technologies to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the early stages of the development lifecycle.
- expanded the implementation of key controls, such as data monitoring and application whitelisting, to further safeguard our critical and key systems.
this targeted expansion broadens the protective scope against potential threats, enhances our detection and response capabilities, and ensures the integrity and availability of essential systems.
- continued investment in machine learning and automation to enable our security operation centre to adequately handle the year-on-year increase in the volume of security events and alerts.
our security operation centre monitors cyber-attacks and incidents including data breaches.
pillar 1: responsible banking - validated more cyber defences and controls against the mitre att&ck framework, simulating the modus operandi of 262 threat actors and 915 cyber-attack techniques.
this ensures that our incident response capabilities are aligned with the latest threat intelligence and are adapted to the emerging and ever-changing cyber exploits.
- continued to expand the scope of our monitoring as we expanded the adoption of public cloud and new cloud technologies, automated the response and investigation of cyber security events and alerts, and enhanced the use cases for our cyber security incident detection and mitigation.
- validated the efficacy of our incident detection and response capabilities in our adversarial attack simulation exercise where the attack attempts were promptly detected and neutralised.
pillar 2: responsible business practices pillar 3: impact beyond banking staying vigilant through knowledge sharing and ecosystem partnerships the interconnected nature of cyber threats and their contagion effect necessitates a comprehensive and collective response from the financial industry and the wider ecosystem.
collaboration with industry partners, peer banks, regulators, law enforcement, and government agencies is integral to tackling prevailing cyber threats.
in view of mobile malware targeting our customers, we participated in an industry effort to share best practices in mobile application security.
for example, we implement and operate runtime application self-protection rasp to safeguard our mobile applications against malware.
additional disclosures from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 68 ceo message under the leadership of the monetary authority of singapore mas, the industry is actively working to establish an information-sharing platform project cosmic.
this platform aims to facilitate timely communication and swift responses to emerging financial crimes, including money laundering and terrorism financing.
read more about project cosmic in our preventing financial crime chapter.
in addition, in collaboration with mas and peer banks, we planned and conducted an industry wide cyber security incident response and recovery exercise which simulated a ransomware attack on key trading systems and the subsequent disruption to our trading and settlement operations.
the exercise provided the opportunity for our business, technology and operations colleagues to test and validate their respective incident response, communication and recovery plans and refine our incident response protocols.
this will allow us to enhance our preparedness and effectively mitigate real-world cyber threats.
dbs is also committed to fostering a robust security awareness and culture among our employees.
we established a security awareness cyphrit programme to reinforce adherence to the bank‚Äôs policies, standards, and cyber security best practices.
implemented across the entire organisation, it features phishing simulations, cybersecurity training including specialised training for developers within the bank, and an enhanced annual cyber security gamification campaign.
the programme garnered participation from over 24,000 staff members.
additionally, dbs hosted its annual application security conference with attendance from developers.
this event underscores our dedication to staying informed and proactive in tackling dynamic cyber security challenges linked to emerging technologies.
enhancing cyber security governance our robust cyber security capabilities and management are underpinned by strong governance and oversight.
cyber security is included in the scope of governance of the newly created brmc technology risk committee.
additionally, cyber security will attain enhanced independent oversight as part of the technology risk management team's transfer to the risk management group.
in response to the cyber security code of practice issued by the cyber security agency of singapore, we have aligned our internal control measures and practices to ensure compliance to the guideline.
we enhanced the risk awareness of our technology staff by implementing a targeted technology and cyber risk training curriculum.
this was delivered through a combination of online elearning modules and in-person seminars across our six core markets.
the training covered a range of technology risk management and cyber security topics.
this ensures that technology teams are familiar with the evolving cyber threat landscape, industry technology and cyber security risk management regulatory regimes and the bank‚Äôs control measures and practices.

from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 69 data governance protecting and being responsible with data our approach at dbs, fostering trust in the way we use and safeguard data remains a critical governance imperative.
with the rapid development in generative artificial intelligence gen ai capabilities, responsible use of data is more important than ever.
we are very cognisant of the delicate balance of harnessing ai's vast potential benefits while addressing its ethical dilemmas.
to ensure the responsible management of data and ai adoption, dbs is committed to: - keeping data safe and secure to strengthen our data protection capabilities, data access controls, and dial up data surveillance to reduce the risk of data leakage and misuse.
- using data responsibly our responsible data use rdu framework is a core pillar of the bank's overall data management approach, ensuring our use of data and artificial intelligence ai is lawful, ethical and fair.
the framework addresses three core questions, can we use it, should we use it and how we use it.
- upholding trust through our privacy posture to place privacy at the heart of our product design and services, we rigorously safeguard the confidentiality and security of data.
key initiatives keeping data safe and secure keeping data safe and secure in 2023, we continued to build on our core data access and security capabilities: - enterprise data security framework edsf provides a platform agnostic data-security-as-a-service that can be leveraged by any application requiring data security.
edsf is continually enhanced with new features.
arculus is our next-generation in-house built data policy engine.
it serves as a data security layer that controls access to data in our enterprise data platform.
arculus has been designed to be scalable and enable regional expansion whilst enhancing data security and privacy engineering capabilities.
arculus is able to orchestrate the dynamic protection of sensitive data using certified encryption methodologies to safeguard our most important data.
furthermore, it enables data access at a persona-level, with datasets fully secured and instantly accessible to analytics users based on the profile of their personas.
this enables the secure delivery of accurate data to the right individuals at the right time.
another critical feature of arculus is its increased ability to capture logging information of data accessed by analytics users as well as the contents of the queries performed.
these enable us to significantly uplift our surveillance capabilities with more sophisticated use cases.
in 2023: - we expanded arculus data access controls to our hybrid-cloud environments, facilitating analytics use-cases that can leverage the capabilities of public clouds, including gen ai.
- we introduced new features in arculus, including the option to generate regional data views through our self-service portal, thereby enhancing the efficiency of specific regional analytics teams.
- we successfully conducted a proof-of-concept exercise for a new privacy engineering technique known as synthetic data.
this method creates a 'synthetic twin' of a real dataset, replacing all personal information with artificial values while preserving key statistical properties.
consequently, privacy is significantly enhanced, while the data's utility for specific analytics use-cases is maintained.
looking ahead, we will continue to build out new components, such as an arculus control room which will provide real-time anomaly detection capabilities, proactive support, self-healing and enhanced surveillance features.
data foundations - can we use it?
the use of data and ai systems is becoming more pervasive and embedded across various industries and sectors.
equally, data related risks are growing and require attention at senior management and board level.
our policy framework provides a robust approach to the foundational elements of data management such as data privacy, data sovereignty, data quality and data security.
the goal is to ensure that any potential use of data strictly adheres to relevant laws and regulations.
our governance architecture ensures that data related risks are managed at operational, senior management and board level.
key initiatives and messages of the rdu framework model governance control 1: can we use it?
- all data in dbs control 2: should we use it?
- data use cases control 3: how we use it?

specifically, our data governance committee dgc and responsible data use rdu committees will now become sub-committees of group operational risk committee gorc and group risk executive committee respectively.
in turn, data-related risk will be escalated to the board risk management committee brmc via these sub-committees in 2024.
this governance structure increases the awareness and oversight of data related risks from an operational level through to board level.
highlights model governance e.
grams., artificial intelligence - how we use it?
we are dedicated to strengthening our governance practices in the development and deployment of advanced ai-based systems, ensuring fairness, transparency, interpretability, and accountability in our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning ai/ml.
the recent rise of gen ai capabilities has introduced new risks and heightened existing areas of concern.
to address this, we are implementing additional guardrails and controls as we gradually explore, test, and adopt these emerging technologies.
generative artificial intelligence gen ai the rapid emergence and evolution of gen ai in late 2022 have garnered global attention, spanning governments, academia, corporates, regulators, and the general public.
predictably, the response and approaches to the introduction of this powerful new technology were diverse.
initial enthusiasm was quickly met with a series of restrictions, lawsuits and national bans on gen ai solution deployment, conflicting perspectives from notable figures and entities, and the early implementation of gen ai guidance and regulations across numerous jurisdictions.
by the end of 2023, a more robust consensus emerged regarding the responsible utilisation of gen ai, emphasising the optimisation of the technology's capabilities and benefits while effectively addressing any inherent risks.
at dbs, we believe that embracing gen ai has the potential to benefit not only our customers and employees but also society at large, aligning with our commitment to help people ‚Äòlive more, bank less‚Äô.
specifically, the exciting opportunities presented by gen ai, such as simplifying and supporting everyday tasks, as well as creating new content, services, and products, are applicable across all industries.
nevertheless, we are mindful of the novel risks and the potential exacerbation of existing ones linked to gen ai.
in embracing gen ai solutions, dbs follows a cautious and measured approach.
our initial experiments and pilots with gen ai are primarily internal and designed with high levels of human oversight and incremental progression.
this approach allows us to explore the potential of gen ai while identifying possible risks and ensuring that we have the necessary safeguards and controls to mitigate these risks.
as an added layer of protection, we have also: established a cross functional responsible ai rai taskforce comprising senior and experienced subject matter experts from across many of our core functions, including cyber security, legal and compliance, data science, technology and infrastructure, data management, and risk management.
this ensures that we can leverage the appropriate expertise to thoroughly evaluate our use case pilots and provide guidance on mitigating any potential risks.
dbs pure framework - should we use it?
it is imperative for us to consistently address the ethical dimensions of our use of data to ensure we remain aligned with the bank‚Äôs core values.
our dbs pure framework continues to serve as the bank‚Äôs ethical compass in ensuring that our use of data is purposeful, unsurprising, respectful and explainable.
to uphold the pure principles amid evolving regulations, changing customer expectations, and societal norms, we have enhanced our pure portal to ensure automatic notifications to all relevant parties when data use cases are due for review.
we furthered our commitment to training and awareness by introducing the digital pure practitioner module.
the move to digital based content increased the accessibility of the training to our dbs colleagues across our core market.
furthermore, we have also included a pure learning component to our new joiner curriculum to underline the importance of responsible data use to all dbs employees, irrespective of their role.
the pure process ensures we continuously strive to build trust with our customers, employees, stakeholders and the communities we live and operate in.
at dbs, our ai adoption is guided by three principles: data safety, responsible utilisation and stringent privacy.
the bank has engineered two in-house solutions: advancing dbs with ai ada for unified data governance, and alan1, an award-winning ai protocol for scalable and rapid ai deployment.
ada centralises data, ensuring governance and quality alan accelerates ai model creation and deployment ada and alan, when used together, enable our teams to swiftly build and deploy ai models, enhancing our operations and decision-making capabilities.
this results in a higher degree of hyper-personalisation in the services we offer to customers ada and alan incorporate specific governance requirements and stringent controls e.
grams., data classification, data reconciliation, approval workflows, etc.
to ensure essential governance considerations are addressed throughout the development lifecycle.
overall, responsible ai and data use are guided by the rdu framework and a cross-functional rdu committee.
we also continue to work closely with regulators and industry bodies to gradually enhance our overall approach and strengthen core governance controls. 1 alan was awarded ‚Äòbest in future of intelligence‚Äô at the idc future enterprise awards singapore in 2021.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 71 ai/ml governance despite significant focus on exploring the opportunities of gen ai, we continued to enhance our governance efforts and controls in managing our more traditional ai/ml solutions.
building on the progress we have made in previous years, enhanced fairness controls for higher materiality models and use cases have been operationalised.
this leverages much of the guidance and toolkit developed as part of the mas feat2 fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency, and veritas3 project which dbs has been proud to participate in since inception.
to supplement this, we have also provided enhanced fairness practitioner training to our data science teams as part of the rollout.
we have also introduced model monitoring guidelines and requirements, focused on ensuring ongoing model performance across various dimensions, including model accuracy, output stability, data quality, fairness, and data drift.
rollout and adoption will be incremental and will focus initially on higher materiality models and all new models in 2024.
as part of the project veritas book of work, an additional document 'from methodologies to integration' was published.
this paper provides an overview of practical challenges and lessons learned from the seven lead consortium members of the project, including dbs, on implementing and integrating the veritas methodology on responsible ai within their organisation and governance processes.
it serves as a useful reference for other financial institutions fis as well as non-fis who are also working towards developing their own ai governance approaches.
dbs remains enthusiastic about engaging in and contributing to collaborative initiatives aimed at fostering ongoing improvements in responsible ai, with the goal of benefiting all stakeholders.
training our people consistent with previous years, we have continued to focus on building data management awareness and capability through investing in training our people.
we now have seven novice and eight practitioner modules on our dbs digify platform.
in 2023 alone, more than 36,000 modules have been completed by 26,000 employees.
since the launch of our first data management training module back in 2019, over 118,000 modules have been successfully completed excluding employees who have since left the bank.
upholding trust through our privacy posture data protection trustmark certification our data protection trustmark certification dptm from the infocomm media development authority of singapore imda underscores our commitment to privacy.
it is an independent external validation that we have robust data protection policies and practices in place, and this gives further assurance to our customers and stakeholders that they can confidently trust us with their data.
upholding our privacy posture we are committed to not taking the trust placed in us lightly and to always take an emphatic and respectful approach towards data privacy.
this commitment is reflected in how we collect, use, and disclose personal data, and entrenched in the following principles: - ensuring transparency we limit our collection, use and disclosure of personal data to what is reasonably necessary for our services.
this is illustrated through our openness about our data processing, which has been detailed in our privacy policy that is published on our website.
our privacy policy is updated regularly to provide timely notification of developments or for consistency with any changes in laws and regulations.
- respecting the privacy of our stakeholders we are reasonable in our use of personal data.
we will only process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
this includes ensuring that there is always a legitimate basis for the collection, use and disclosure of personal data.
- intentionally embedding data protection impact assessments we have embedded data protection impact assessments in our governance review processes before the launch of new products and services, or when sharing these data via outsourcing and procurement arrangements.
these assessments are designed to evaluate relevant data protection risks and implement necessary controls.
contractual obligations are also imposed on recipients of personal data to ensure that they are obligated to protect and limit the use of the personal data shared.
- adhering to established data breach management processes we have implemented data breach management standards and processes to ensure the prompt identification, escalation, and management of data breach incidents.
notifications are provided to the relevant authorities and affected data subjects as required, in accordance with applicable laws and requirements.
training employees regularly employees, including new hires and contract staff, undergo regular training to reinforce sensitivities around the proper management of personal data.
this training emphasises strict compliance with established handling protocols and processes for personal data.
regulatory & industry engagement as the regulatory landscape evolves to address the increasing awareness of privacy concerns and advancements in technologies, we uphold the perspective that privacy and data protection regimes across jurisdictions are interconnected.
it is crucial that we stay agile in adapting to new trends and requirements while carefully recalibrating our privacy policies and practices as necessary.
while monitoring emerging regulatory requirements and developments, we remain vigilant about significant changes to data governance risk themes and updates to data protection standards or controls implementation.
these updates are communicated to the group operational risk committee, risk executive committee exco and our board committee.
furthermore, we continue to lend our voice to help shape regulatory thinking in the formulation of data protection and privacy legislation, as well as development of data governance themes. 2 mas feat is a set of principles covering the four dimensions to promote ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in finance. 3 veritas is a mas-led multi-phased collaborative project that aims to enable financial institutions to evaluate their artificial intelligence for document automation aida-driven solutions against the mas feat principles.
ceo message - our ceo remains a member of singapore's advisory council on the ethical use of ai and data.
the advisory council advises and collaborates with the singapore government on the responsible development and deployment of ai, aiding the government in formulating ethics standards, reference governance frameworks, and publishing advisory guidelines, practical guides, and codes of practice for voluntary industry adoption.
- in 2023, we actively supported the imda's efforts in its promotion of its dptm programme.
we recognised its significance in expanding the community of organisations independently certified in the safeguarding and handling of personal data, and in turn broadening the base and strengthening trust within our society.
brain icon with ai label highlights project mindforge in early 2023, the monetary authority of singapore mas initiated an industry-focused gen ai project to drive innovation and responsible use of gen ai for the financial service industry.
project mindforge explores the risks and opportunities of gen ai and aims to develop a clear and concise framework for the responsible use of gen ai within the financial sector.
the objective is to address common industry-wide challenges and bolster risks management through the strategic utilisation of gen ai.
mas established a consortium of financial industry companies, leading technology providers and consultancies to drive this initiative.
the successful conclusion of phase one of the project will culminate in the publication of a white paper.
this document will delve into the benefits of gen ai within the banking context, present a comprehensive gen ai risk framework tailored for the financial services industry and assess the application of existing feat principles and veritas methodology to effectively address gen ai risks.
it also intends to provide guidance on infrastructure considerations when implementing gen ai enabled solutions.
this is an important first step for the industry in terms of providing a starting point to better understand the potential application and risks associated with gen ai at such an early stage of evolution.
moving forward, project mindforge may consider opportunities to broaden its scope by engaging financial institutions from the insurance and asset management sectors.
this expansion aims to ensure comprehensive and full coverage of the gen ai risk framework within the entire financial industry.
the consortium may also expand the thematic scope of gen ai experiments to include areas such as anti-money laundering, sustainability, and cyber security.
project mindforge was showcased at the singapore fintech festival in november 2023, where an executive summary of the whitepaper was released for the event.
the complete whitepaper is anticipated to be published in early 2024, serving as valuable framework for the broader industry venturing into gen ai adoption.
following the model of mas feat and mas veritas, dbs welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with regulatory and industry partners in advancing more resilient and sustainable responsible ai practices.

leveraging data and technology to enhance surveillance our financial crime risk mitigation programme employs a variety of artificial intelligence and machine learning ai/ml capabilities to complement rules-based engines.
this approach establishes a multi-layered surveillance strategy aimed at safeguarding our customers from financial crime.
customer due diligence has been further enhanced with dynamic analytical reviews based on changes in static data or transactional behaviour.
read more about our approach to ethical ai governance in our data governance chapter.
improving risk surveillance and controls execution money launderers and terrorist networks constantly evolve their methodology and tactics to conceal their illicit transactions and activities.
our risk surveillance systems are tuned to effectively detect them from micro to macro levels, through an extensive suite of risk surveillance tools.
these surveillance tools have been enhanced and augmented through data analytics and ai/ml over the years to enable more robust detections of suspicious transactions and identification of bad actors.
we have incorporated the macro payment flow dashboard into our processes in recent years, enabling us to concentrate on the trends of significant payment flows or those displaying unusual patterns.
the platform enables a holistic overview of fund flows at both geographical and bank level.
suspicious flows undergo data analytics to identify customer networks and transaction patterns, facilitating thorough analysis and scrutiny.
this approach enables the detection and mitigation of bad actors at scale, surpassing the capabilities of traditional monitoring.
in conjunction with our comprehensive suite of financial crime dashboards, we conduct monitoring across multiple sets of metrics, including kyc operations, customer portfolio distribution, and key risk typologies.
this approach ensures the prompt identification and addressing of any emerging risks.
since initiating our phased deployment of the dynamic review assessment dra in 2021, full operationalisation has been achieved for the corporate banking and private banking segments in singapore.
dra leverages data analytics to analyse changes in customer profiles, transactional patterns and account activity, allowing a risk-based approach to conduct customer due diligence.
this has enabled a highly efficient way of allocating resources, allowing analysts to focus on customers with behavioural red flags and changes in a timelier and more targeted manner.
the various dynamic sanctions regimes prevalent in the current global landscape require a robust and balanced approach to sanctions risk management.
we continually evaluate our risk appetite and control measures to ensure full compliance with relevant regulations and sanctions.
we leverage data and ai/ml tools to enhance our sanctions risk monitoring, utilising tools like the macro payment flow dashboard to identify potential sanctions evasion flows.
this enables us to improve the efficiency of transaction screening, allowing for more effective resource allocation.
protecting our customers from scams amidst the rising adoption of digital payment channels, scams persist as a threat in singapore.
as part of our commitment to combat scam and protect customers, we employ a multi-prong approach, ensuring a secure banking environment for our customers and bolstering confidence in digital payments.
we continue to evolve and strengthen our fraud prevention measures in response to the ever-changing modus operandi of fraudsters.
the use of ai/ml enhances our fraud surveillance capabilities.
this includes the deployment of a machine learning model for improved detection of fraudulent transactions and the utilisation of behavioural biometrics to uncover unauthorised mobile banking activities.
in september 2023, we announced new anti-malware security measures aimed at enhancing customer protection amid fast-evolving scam typologies and fraud tactics.
when a customer logs into dbs/posb digibank on their mobile device, the tool will restrict access to the banking application if it detects the presence of malware or malicious applications downloaded from unverified sources.
additionally, access is limited if there is ongoing screen-sharing on the device.
tight execution of controls while technology and data analytics continue to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency in financial crime prevention, training and awareness continues to be instrumental.
we equip our employees with the knowledge to identify financial crime risks and empower them to take the necessary actions to mitigate such risks.
appropriate escalation channels are also set up to facilitate timely intervention on complex issues.
all new hires, including part-time and contract staff, must undergo mandatory training on financial crime prevention.
this training covers areas such as aml and sanctions, anti-fraud, anti-bribery & corruption and the code of conduct.
it includes relevant case studies to cultivate effective risk management and decision-making skills.
similarly, existing employees also need to complete mandatory training. 1 every bank employee is required to annually attest that they understand, observe, and will promote compliance with the spirit and letter of our code of conduct.
in 2023, we also included an anti-bribery and corruption pack as part of the induction exercise for new board members.
as part of our financial crime programme, we conduct regular quality assurance testing and audits to ensure proper execution of our aml/cft controls.
quality assurance testing is conducted on customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and customer screening reviews to evaluate whether these controls are executed in accordance with established protocols.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 75 collaborative partnerships with the wider industry financial crime prevention requires the collective effort of regulators, the financial industry, consumers, and law enforcement agencies.
we actively engage in public-private sector collaborations between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, contributing our expertise.
additionally, we maintain ongoing collaborations with our ecosystem partners to defend the integrity of the financial system.
some of our key partnerships and collaborations include: - aml/cft industry partnership acip - a private-public collaboration which brings together financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement agencies to address key and emerging money laundering and terrorism financing risks in singapore.
- mas-led project cosmic 2 - a digital platform facilitating the sharing of key customer and transaction information on bad actors amongst financial institutions where we are one of the six participating banks.
this accelerates the detection and disruption of key financial crime activities by bridging the information gaps between financial institutions, which are abused by criminals for money laundering purposes.
- dbs digivault - allows customers to set aside and "lock up" a certain amount of funds that cannot be transferred out digitally.
launched in november 2023, dbs digivault reinforces the bank‚Äôs commitment to protecting our customers.
for example, a one-month joint operation with the singapore police force in june and july 2023 disrupted more than 1,400 active scam cases and mitigated over singapore dollar 220 million in potential scam losses.
this was achieved through a proactive and victim-centric approach that utilised technology and data tracing to identify scam victims and alert them promptly.
harnessing data analytics for a holistic scam management strategy the scale and sophistication of scams in singapore continue to grow significantly, further compounded by the rising issue of money mules.
scam prevention and money mules hunting have become increasingly intertwined, requiring a holistic strategy and dedicated effort along both lines.
we have invested significantly in enhancing our proprietary fraud surveillance engine over the years and continue to do so.
in 2022, we successfully incorporated an ai/ml model into our fraud surveillance systems to uplift effectiveness in fraud detection and continued to refine the model in 2023.
our approach to scam management utilises data systematically to monitor fraud trends and emerging typologies.
this allows our fraud surveillance systems to be subjected to a rigorous regime of continual calibrations and enhancements.
our dedicated anti-scam team ast operates round the clock to help customers manage potential fraud transactions.
as the first bank to co-locate an ast staff with the singapore police force's anti-scam command asc in 2021, we have expanded our collaboration by adding two more members between 2022 and 2023.
this augmentation strengthens our partnership with asc in the ongoing efforts to combat scams and perform loss recovery actions.
in 2023, we accelerated the use of our data analytical approach to identify money mule networks and clusters by analysing fund flows, addresses, and common login devices.
this enables the detection and swift action against money mules at scale and speed.
we heightened our efforts in identifying money mules through various fronts, such as expanding our fraud surveillance system to monitor mule activities and utilising transaction data to identify and flag suspicious behaviour related to money muling.
the anti-mules team amt was established in 2023 to complement the ast and mitigate fraud risk holistically.
the amt is dedicated to detecting and disrupting money mule activities, leveraging our extensive array of data tools and applying effective mitigating controls.
in our ongoing efforts to combat scams, we emphasise the importance of vigilance and surveillance.
additionally, we are committed to enhancing digital and human interactions through public engagement and supporting scam victims.

the csa translates the effects of policy and regulation changes, technology development and changes in consumer preferences as defined by a set of standard climate scenarios for example from the network of greening the financial system ngfs, into impacts to key financial drivers identified for each sector.
the csa is based on a bottom-up approach where relevant company and industry information such as company financials and emissions data are used to determine the impact on the company's credit rating, leveraging on the ngfs scenarios.
scenario data include, for example, primary, secondary, and final energy consumption, emissions data, carbon price, price indices for key energy variables.
the data used are sector-specific and may be further expanded to capture key dynamics of specific sectors.
a total of nine sectors selected based on their significance within the ibg portfolio and carbon emissions contribution were included in the transition risk scenario analyses.
these included power, oil and gas, automotive, aviation, shipping, real estate, steel, chemicals, as well as food and agribusiness.
we used relevant company financials and industry-specific data to perform the bottom-up modelling for each company.
the methodology identifies and assesses how key drivers such as production volume, unit cost of production, selling price, capital expenditure and asset value, impact the financial statements of companies and consequently changes to credit ratings over the forecast horizon.
to assess the rest of the portfolio not covered by the csa models, a top-down analysis was conducted whereby companies were selected based on their materiality, data availability and representativeness of the sector.
key insights derived from these companies in the bottom-up analysis were then extrapolated to the rest of the corporate lending portfolio.
scenario models - emissions and climate forcing - climate impacts - climate projections - socioeconomic information sector-agnostic transition parameters - carbon price - emissions intensity sector-specific transition parameters - as example: - growth rate of different modes of transportation - information on power plants - battery cost key drivers - volume - unit cost - price - capital expenditure - asset value company-level financial statements scenario-adjusted - income statement - balance sheet - cash flow statement credit score model - internal credit rating model limitations climate risk scenario analysis is an important tool to assess the resilience of a bank's business models and strategies to a range of plausible climate related pathways, and to determine the impact of climate-related risk drivers on overall risk profile.
outcome of scenario analysis can also be used to assess the risk implications of various decarbonisation pathways and deviations therefrom.
meanwhile, since the area of climate scenario analysis and the associated modelling is still evolving and an industry standard has yet to emerge, it is important that the uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario analysis are understood to ensure that the results are interpreted and used appropriately. 1 climate scenarios: with the growth in scenario analysis use cases, and as industry practitioners and regulators gain more insights therefrom, ongoing updates and improvements of the scenarios are expected and noted on ngfs scenarios.
users will need to understand the implications and adjust the models accordingly.
extended horizon: time horizon of over 30 years is typical of scenario analysis e.
grams., transition risk analysis typically goes to at least 2050 to align with net zero goal horizon, while physical risk analysis can be of longer horizon.
this is much longer than typical business planning horizon, with uncertainties arising from technological development, demographic change, and climate tipping point events, among others.
data: bottom-up firm level analysis requires granular data such as absolute emissions or intensity for various scope of a firm's activities, which currently varies in terms of availability, granularity, and accuracy.
methodology: modelling practices are still evolving in the absence of market standards, in particular on physical risk modelling due to the heavy reliance on good quality location-specific data and hazard estimates.
with the ongoing improvement of data availability and updates in scenarios and tools available in the market, it is expected that the methodology of modelling the transmission mechanism of climate related financial risks will be further fine-tuned over time.
with the focus on climate risk scenario analysis by the industry and regulators, it is expected that continuous effort will be invested to address such limitations over the next couple of years.
physical risk the forward-looking physical risk analysis is conducted based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 1 as described below: - very high climate change scenario ssp5-8.5: low mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions triple by 2075 and global average temperatures rise by 3.3-5.7 ¬∞c by 2100.
- high climate change scenario ssp3-7.0: limited mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions double by 2100 and global average temperatures rise by 2.8-4.6 ¬∞c by 2100.
- intermediate climate change scenario ssp2-4.5: strong mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions stabilise around current levels until 2050 and then decline but not reaching net zero by 2100.
this scenario is expected to result in global average temperatures rising by 2.1-3.5 ¬∞c by 2100.
- low climate change scenario ssp1-2.6: aggressive mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions reduce to net zero by 2050, resulting in global average temperatures rising by 1.3-2.4 ¬∞c by 2100. 1 source: ipcc ar6 report notes: - the image contains additional information marked by red rectangles and names 1043.png no content was generated for page 105.
