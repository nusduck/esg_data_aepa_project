footnotes: 1. effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2022 2. effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023 3. the amendments shall be applied prospectively to the sale or contribution of assets occurring in annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined.
amendments to hkas 1, classification of liabilities as current or non-current and hk interpretation 5 2020 , presentation of financial statements – classification by the borrower of a term loan that contains a repayment on demand clause the amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current is based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period, specify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and explain that rights are in existence if covenants are complied with at the end of the reporting period.
the amendments also introduce a definition of ‘settlement’ to make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.
hk int 5 2020 was revised as a consequence of the amendments to hkas 1 issued in august 2020. the revision to hk int 5 2020 updates the wordings in the interpretation to align with the amendments to hkas 1 with no change in conclusion and do not change the existing requirements.
coastal greenland limited annual report 2021/22 2. application of new and amendments to hong kong financial reporting standards “hkfrss” continued b new/revised hkfrss that have been issued but are not yet effective continued amendments to hkas 1 and hkfrs practice statement 2, disclosure of accounting policies the key amendments to hkas 1 include: requiring companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies; clarifying that accounting policies related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions are themselves immaterial and as such need not be disclosed; and clarifying that not all accounting policies that relate to material transactions, other events or conditions are themselves material to a company's financial statements.
amended hkfrs practice statement 2 includes guidance and two additional examples on the application of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.
amendments to hkas 8, definition of accounting estimates the amendments introduce a new definition for accounting estimates: clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.
the amendments also clarify the relationship between accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that a company develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy.
hkfrs 17 — insurance contracts and related amendments hkfrs 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes hkfrs 4 insurance contracts.
hkfrs 17 outlines a general model, which is modified for insurance contracts with direct participation features, described as the variable fee approach.
the general model is simplified if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining coverage using the premium allocation approach.
the general model will use current assumptions to estimate the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and it will explicitly measure the cost of that uncertainty; it takes into account market interest rates and the impact of policyholders' options and guarantees.
2. application of new and amendments to hong kong financial reporting standards “hkfrss” continued b new/revised hkfrss that have been issued but are not yet effective continued hkfrs 17 — insurance contracts and related amendments continued the implementation of hkfrs 17 is likely to bring significant changes to an entity's processes and systems, and will require much greater co-ordination between many functions of the business, including finance, actuarial and information technology.
the hkicpa issued amendments to hkfrs 17 to address concerns and implementation challenges that were identified after hkfrs 17 was published.
the amendments defer the date of initial application of hkfrs 17 incorporating the amendments to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023. at the same time, the hkicpa issued amendments to hkfrs 4 extension of the temporary exemption from hkfrs 9 that extends the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from applying hkfrs 9 in hkfrs 4 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023. hkfrs 17 is applied retrospectively unless impracticable, in which case the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach is applied.
for the purpose of the transition requirements, the date of initial application is the start of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the standard, and the transition date is the beginning of the period immediately preceding the date of initial application.
the directors of the company do not anticipate that the application of this standard and amendments in the future will have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
amendments to hkas 12, deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction the amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences — e.grams. leases and decommissioning liabilities.
for leases and decommissioning liabilities, the associated deferred tax asset and liabilities will need to be recognised from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date.
for all other transactions, the amendments apply to transactions that occur after the beginning of the earliest period presented.
2. application of new and amendments to hong kong financial reporting standards “hkfrss" continued b new/revised hkfrss that have been issued but are not yet effective continued amendments to hkfrs 3, reference to the conceptual framework the amendments update hkfrs 3 so that it refers to the revised conceptual framework for financial reporting 2018 instead of the version issued in 2010. the amendments add to hkfrs 3 a requirement that, for obligations within the scope of hkas 37, an acquirer applies hkas 37 to determine whether at the acquisition date a present obligation exists as a result of past events.
for a levy that would be within the scope of hk ifric -int 21 levies, the acquirer applies hk ifric -int 21 to determine whether the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay the levy has occurred by the acquisition date.
the amendments also add an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets acquired in a business combination.
amendments to hkfrs 10 and hkas 28, sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture the amendments clarify the extent of gains or losses to be recognised when an entity sells or contributes assets to its associate or joint venture.
when the transaction involves a business the gain or loss is recognised in full, conversely when the transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business the gain or loss is recognised only to the extent of the unrelated investors' interests in the joint venture or associate.
amendments to hkas 16, proceeds before intended use the amendments prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
instead, the proceeds from selling such items, and the cost of producing those items, is recognised in profit or loss.
amendments to hkas 37, onerous contracts – cost of fulfilling a contract the amendments specify that the ‘cost of fulfilling' a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract'.
costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract e.grams. direct labour and materials or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts e.grams. the allocation of the depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract . there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
there are also no images to replace with placeholders.
2. application of new and amendments to hong kong financial reporting standards “hkfrss” continued b new/revised hkfrss that have been issued but are not yet effective continued annual improvements to hkfrss 2018-2020 the annual improvements amend a number of standards, including: hkfrs 1, first-time adoption of hong kong financial reporting standards, which permit a subsidiary that applies paragraph d16 a of hkfrs 1 to measure cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by its parent, based on the parent's date of transition to hkfrss.
hkfrs 9, financial instruments, which clarify the fees included in the '10 per cent' test in paragraph b3.3.6 of hkfrs 9 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability, explaining that only fees paid or received between the entity and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on other's behalf are included.
hkfrs 16, leases, which amend illustrative example 13 to remove the illustration of reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how lease incentives are illustrated in that example.
hkas 41, agriculture, which remove the requirement to exclude taxation cash flows when measuring the fair value of a biological asset using a present value technique.
the group is not yet in a position to state whether these new pronouncements will result in substantial changes to the group's accounting policies and consolidated financial statements.
3. basis of preparation a statement of compliance the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable hkfrss, hong kong accounting standards “hkass” and interpretations hereinafter collectively referred to as the “hkfrss” and the disclosure requirements of the hong kong companies ordinance.
in addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the rules governing the listing of securities on the stock exchange of hong kong limited the “listing rules” . 3. basis of preparation continued b basis of measurement the consolidated financial statements are prepared under historical cost convention except for certain property, plant and equipment, investment properties and financial assets which are stated at revalued amounts or fair values.
the measurement bases are fully described in the accounting policies below.
the significant accounting policies that have been used in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
the adoption of revised/amended hkfrss and the impacts on the group’s financial statements, if any, are disclosed in note 2. it should be noted that accounting estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements.
although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge and judgement of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 5. c going concern basis the group incurred a net loss of approximately hong kong dollar1,081,487,000 during the year ended 31 march 2022, this condition may cast significant doubt about the group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
for assessing the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the directors of the company prepared a cash flow projection for a fifteen month period from 31 march 2022. the directors of the company have given careful consideration to the future liquidity and performance of the group and its available sources of financing in assessing whether the group will have sufficient financial resources to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from 31 march 2022, after taking into consideration a number of plans and measures: - subsequent to the reporting period, a substantial shareholder of the company to whom the group owed hong kong dollar180,883,000 as at 31 march 2022 note 41 a ii has undertaken not to demand repayment of debts due from the group in next twelve months from the reporting date; in addition, the substantial shareholder further advanced hong kong dollar79,000,000 to the group with the same terms as with the hong kong dollar180,883,000 as stated above to strength the group’s liquidity position; - the group is endeavoring to complete the settlement of other payables and accruals of hong kong dollar365,352,000 as disclosed in note 29; 3. basis of preparation continued c going concern basis continued in respect of the advances of hong kong dollar1,569,124,000 from a third party for a redevelopment project note 29 which is located in zhuhai city of the prc, the group is progressing its contemplated disposal of the related project to the creditor who showed an intention to acquire that redevelopment project.
based on the assessment made by the directors of the company, the value of the redevelopment project is sufficient for the settlement of this advance; and - exploring other financing alternatives when necessary, including disposal of the redevelopment project to other parties.
based on the above plans and measures, the directors of the company is of the view that the group would have sufficient working capital to finance its operation and meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due over the period of the cash flow projection.
accordingly, the directors of the company considered that it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.
4. significant accounting policies a business combination and basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries.
inter-company transactions and balances between group companies together with unrealised profits are eliminated in full in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment on the asset transferred, in which case the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the effective dates of acquisition or up to the effective dates of disposal, as appropriate.
where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the group.
subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests that represent present ownership interests in the subsidiary is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus such non-controlling interest's share of subsequent changes in equity.
total comprehensive income is attributed to such non-controlling interests even if this results in those non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
4. significant accounting policies continued b subsidiary a subsidiary is an investee over which the company is able to exercise control.
the company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the investee, and the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns.
control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
in the note to the consolidated financial statements which discloses the company’s statement of financial position, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment loss, if any.
the results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the company on the basis of dividend received and receivable.
c associates an associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement.
significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control over those policies.
associates are accounted for using the equity method whereby they are initially recognised at cost and thereafter, their carrying amount are adjusted for the group’s share of the post-acquisition change in the associates’ net assets except that losses in excess of the group’s interest in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
profits and losses arising on transactions between the group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the associate.
the investor’s share in the associate’s profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
where unrealised losses provide evidence of impairment of the asset transferred they are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate.
where there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate has been impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
in the company’s statement of financial position, investments in associates are carried at cost less impairment losses, if any.
the results of associates are accounted for by the company on the basis of dividends received and receivable during the year.
4. significant accounting policies continued d joint arrangements the group is a party to a joint arrangement where there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the arrangement to the group and at least one other party.
joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
the group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either: joint ventures: where the group has rights to only the net assets of the joint arrangement; or joint operations: where the group has both the rights to assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
in assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the group considers: the structure of the joint arrangement; the legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle; the contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement; and any other facts and circumstances including any other contractual arrangements . the group accounts for its interests in joint ventures in the same manner as investments in associates i.e., using the equity method — see note 4 c . any premium paid for an investment in a joint venture above the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment in joint venture.
where there is objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
the group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.
the company’s interests in joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.
results of joint ventures are accounted for by the company on the basis of dividends received and receivable.
notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2022 4. significant accounting policies continued e property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and any subsequent accumulated impairment losses, if any.
revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity such that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.
any revaluation increase arising on revaluation of land and buildings is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in leasehold property revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously charged.
a decrease in net carrying amount arising on revaluation of an asset is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, on the revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
on the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued asset, the attributable revaluation surplus is transferred to retained profits.
subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
all other repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
property, plant and equipment are depreciated so as to write off their cost net of estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives on straight-line method.
the estimated useful lives, estimated residual value and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
the principal annual rates of depreciation are as follows: leasehold improvements: 10%-20% or the shorter of the lease furniture, fixtures and equipment: 10%-20% motor vehicles: 20% an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is higher than the asset's estimated recoverable amount.
gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sale proceeds and its carrying amount, and is recognised in profit or loss on disposal.
4. significant accounting policies continued f leasehold land and building when the group makes payments for ownership interests of properties which includes both land and building elements, the entire consideration is allocated between the land and the building elements in proportion to the relative fair values at initial recognition.
to the extent the allocation of the relevant payments can be made reliably, interest in leasehold land is presented as “right-of-use assets” as stated in note 4 k except for those that are classified and accounted for as investment properties under the fair value model.
when the consideration cannot be allocated reliably between non-lease building element and undivided interest in the underlying land, the entire properties are classified as property, plant and equipment.
grams investment property investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation including properties under construction for such purposes . investment properties are initially measured at cost, including any directly attributable expenditure.
subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at their fair values.
gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
in circumstances where the fair values of the investment properties under construction are not reliably determinable, such investment properties under construction are measured at cost less impairment, if any, until when their fair values become reliably determinable, which occur upon finalisation of the development plan, at which point in time the land and relocation costs and construction costs attributable to the investment property is reliably determinable.
construction costs incurred for investment properties under construction are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the investment properties under construction.
an investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposals.
any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised.
4. significant accounting policies continued h properties under development properties under development are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost includes the cost of land, development expenditure, borrowing costs capitalised, and other attributable expenses.
net realisable value is determined by management based on prevailing market conditions.
i completed properties for sale completed properties for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost is determined by an apportionment of the total cost of land, development expenditure, borrowing cost capitalised and other direct costs attributable to unsold properties.
net realisable value is determined by management based on prevailing market prices, on an individual property basis.
j impairment of non-financial assets at the end of each reporting period, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets and the company’s investment in subsidiaries to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss or an impairment loss previously recognised no longer exists or may have reduced.
if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any . where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit “cgu” to which the asset belongs.
where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cgus, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cgus for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use.
in assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cgu is reduced to its recoverable amount.
an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cgu is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cgu in prior years.
a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
notes : this section details the accounting policies for properties under development, completed properties for sale, and the impairment of non-financial assets for coastal greenland limited's annual report 2021/22.
4. significant accounting policies continued k leasing all leases irrespective of whether they are operating leases or finance leases are required to be capitalised in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but accounting policy choices exist for an entity to choose not to capitalise i leases which are short-term leases and/or ii leases for which the underlying asset is of low-value.
the group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets and leases for which at the commencement date have a lease term less than 12 months.
the lease payments associated with those leases have been expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
right-of-use asset the right-of-use asset should be recognised at cost and would comprise: i the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability see below for the accounting policy to account for lease liability ; ii any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; iii any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and iv an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.
the group measures the right-to-use at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability.
for right-of-use asset that meets the definition of a leasehold land and buildings held for own use, they are carried at fair value.
right-of-use assets generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
the group accounts for leasehold land and buildings which is held for own use under hkas 16 and are carried at fair value.
other than the above right-of-use assets, the group also has leased a number of properties under tenancy agreements which the group exercises its judgement and determines that it is a separate class of asset apart from the leasehold land and buildings which is held for own use.
as a result, the right-of-use asset arising from the properties under tenancy agreements are carried at depreciated cost.
lease liabilities the lease liability is recognised at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the date of commencement of the lease.
the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined.
if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group uses the group’s incremental borrowing rate.
notes to the consolidated financial statements 4. significant accounting policies continued k leasing continued l lease liabilities continued the following payments for the right-to-use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease are considered to be lease payments: i fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable; ii variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at commencement date; iii amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; iv the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and v payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
subsequent to the commencement date, the group measures the lease liability by: i increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability; ii reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and iii remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, e.grams., a change in future lease payments arising from change in an index or rate, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in assessment to purchase the underlying asset.
accounting as lessor the group has leased out its investment property to a number of tenants.
rental income from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on the straight-line basis over the lease term.
l financial instruments i financial assets a financial asset unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fvtpl, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
a trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.
all regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, that is, the date that the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.
there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
4. significant accounting policies continued i financial instruments continued i financial assets continued financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.
debt instruments subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.
there are three measurement categories into which the group classifies its debt instruments: amortised cost: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost.
financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method.
interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
any gain on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
fvtoci: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fvtoci.
debt investments at fvtoci are subsequently measured at fair value.
interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
other net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
on derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
fvtpl: financial assets at fvtpl include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fvtpl, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value.
financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fvtpl, irrespective of the business model.
notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost or at fvtoci, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at fvtpl on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
4. significant accounting policies continued i financial instruments continued i financial assets continued equity instruments on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the group could irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income.
this election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
equity investments at fvtoci are measured at fair value.
dividend income are recognised in profit or loss unless the dividend income clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investments.
other net gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss.
all other equity instruments are classified as fvtpl, whereby changes in fair value, dividends and interest income are recognised in profit or loss.
ii impairment loss on financial assets the group recognises loss allowances for expected credit loss “ecl” on trade receivables, contract assets, financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt investments measured at fvtoci.
the ecls are measured on either of the following bases: 1 twelve months ecls: these are the ecls that result from possible default events within the twelve months after the reporting date; and 2 lifetime ecls: these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk.
ecls are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses.
credit losses are measured as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive.
the shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the assets’ original effective interest rate.
the group has elected to measure loss allowances for trade receivables and contract assets using hkfrs 9 simplified approach and has calculated ecls based on lifetime ecls.
the group has established a provision matrix that is based on the group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
for other debt financial assets, the ecls are based on the twelve months ecls.
however, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ecls.
4. significant accounting policies continued i financial instruments continued ii impairment loss on financial assets continued when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecl, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.
this includes both quantitative and qualitative information analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
the group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.
the group considers a financial asset to be credit-impaired when: 1 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held ; or 2 the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.
interest income on credit-impaired financial assets is calculated based on the amortised cost i.e. the gross carrying amount less loss allowance of the financial asset.
for non-credit-impaired financial assets interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount.
iii financial liabilities the group classifies its financial liabilities, depending on the purpose for which the liabilities were incurred.
financial liabilities at fvtpl are initially measured at fair value and financial liabilities at amortised costs are initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable costs incurred.
financial liabilities at amortised cost financial liabilities at amortised cost including trade and other payables, borrowings, certain preference shares and the debt element of convertible loan note issued by the group are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
the related interest expense is recognised in profit or loss.
gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2022 4. significant accounting policies continued i financial instruments continued iv effective interest method the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial asset or liability, or where appropriate, a shorter period.
v equity instruments equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
vi financial guarantee contracts a financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
a financial guarantee contract issued by the group and not designated as at fvtpl is recognised initially at its fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial guarantee contract.
subsequent to initial recognition, the group measures the financial guarantee contact at the higher of: i the amount of the loss allowance, being the ecl provision measured in accordance with principles of the accounting policy set out in note 4 l ii ; and ii the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the principles of hkfrs 15. vii derecognition the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the future cash flows in relation to the financial asset expire or when the financial asset has been transferred and the transfer meets the criteria for derecognition in accordance with hkfrs 9. financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the relevant contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
where the group issues its own equity instruments to a creditor to settle a financial liability in whole or in part as a result of renegotiating the terms of that liability, the equity instruments issued are the consideration paid and are recognised initially and measured at their fair value on the date the financial liability or part thereof is extinguished.
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments are measured to reflect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished.
the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability or part thereof extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss for the year.
4. significant accounting policies continued meter income taxes income taxes for the year comprise current tax and deferred tax.
current tax is based on the profit or loss from ordinary activities adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable for income tax purposes and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for tax purposes.
except for goodwill and recognized assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences.
deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates appropriate to the expected manner in which the carrying amount of the asset or liability is realized or settled and that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
income taxes are recognized in profit or loss except when they relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income, in which case the taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive income.
n cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, demand deposits with banks and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and form an integral part of the group’s cash management.
o provisions and contingent liabilities provisions are recognized for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount when the group has a legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, which will probably result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2022 4. significant accounting policies continued o provisions and contingent liabilities continued where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
possible obligations, the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
p revenue recognition revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, excluding those amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
revenue excludes value added tax or other sales taxes and is after deduction of any trade discounts.
depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the goods or service may be transferred over time or at a point in time.
control of the goods or service is transferred over time if the group's performance: provides all of the benefits received and consumed simultaneously by the customer; creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the group performs; or does not create an asset with an alternative use to the group and the group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
if control of the goods or services transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.
otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods or service.
when the contract contains a financing component which provides the customer a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer for more than one year, revenue is measured at the present value of the amounts receivable, discounted using the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the group and the customer at contract inception.
where the contract contains a financing component which provides a significant financing benefit to the group, revenue recognised under that contract includes the interest expense accreted on the contract liability under the effective interest method.
for contracts where the period between the payment and the transfer of the promised goods or services is one year or less, the transaction price is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component, using the practical expedient in hkfrs 15. there are no footnotes or additional annotations in this image.
4. significant accounting policies continued p revenue recognition continued i sale of properties revenue from sales of properties is recognised when the respective properties have been completed and delivered to the customers which is a point in time when customers have the ability to direct the use of the properties and obtain substantially all benefits of the properties.
deposits received from customers prior to meeting the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria are regarded as the contract liabilities and included in current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.
the group considers that the pre-sale proceeds received on sales of properties do not contain significant financing component as the contracts where the period between payment and transfer of the associated properties is less than one year, the group applied the practical expedient of not adjusting the transaction price for any significant financing component.
for the contracts that contain the performance obligation of providing financial guarantee to banks with respect to mortgage loans procured by the purchasers of the group's properties in the contracts on sales of properties, the group should allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations between the sales of properties and provision of financial guarantee on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
the group considers that the impact in the allocation of provision of financial guarantee on a relative stand-alone selling price basis is insignificant and thus all the revenue recognised from the contracts with customers on sales of properties is then allocated to the revenue from sales of completed properties for sale.
ii project management service income revenue arising from project management service income is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
the group bills for each month of service provided and recognises as revenue in the amount to which the group has a right to invoice and corresponds directly with the value of performance completed.
iii other income rental income under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the dividend is established.
4. significant accounting policies continued p revenue recognition continued iii other income continued contract assets and liabilities a contract asset represents the group’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the group has transferred to a customer that is not yet unconditional.
in contrast, a receivable represents the group’s unconditional right to consideration, i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due.
a contract liability represents the group’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the group has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer.
contract asset is recognised when i the group completes the property development under such services contracts but yet certified by architects, surveyors or other representatives appointed by customers, or ii the customers retain retention money to secure the due performance of the contracts.
any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer.
if the considerations including advances received from customers exceeds the revenue recognised to date under the output method then the group recognises a contract liability for the difference.
contract costs the group recognises an asset from the costs incurred to fulfil a contract when those costs meet all of the following criteria: the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify; the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying or in continuing to satisfy performance obligations in the future; and the costs are expected to be recovered.
the asset recognised is subsequently amortised to profit or loss on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the cost relate.
the asset is subject to impairment review.
4. significant accounting policies continued q employee benefits i short-term employee benefits short-term employee benefits are employee benefits other than termination benefits that are expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service.
short-term employee benefits are recognized in the year when the employees render the related service.
ii employee leave entitlements employee entitlements to annual leave are recognized when they accrue to employees.
a provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.
employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognized until the time of leave.
iii retirement scheme obligations the group operates a defined contribution mandatory provident fund retirement benefit scheme the “mpf scheme” under the mandatory provident fund schemes ordinance.
contributions are made based on a percentage of the employees’ basic salaries and are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
the assets of the mpf scheme are held separately from those of the group in an independently administered fund.
the group’s contributions vest fully with the employees when contributed into the mpf scheme.
the employees of the group’s subsidiaries which operate in the prc are required to participate in a central pension scheme operated by the local municipal government.
the prc subsidiaries are required to contribute a certain percentage of their payroll costs to the central pension scheme.
the contributions are charged to profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the central pension scheme.
r share-based payments where share options are awarded to employees and others providing similar services, the fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the options at the date of grant.
such fair value is recognized in profit or loss over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in the share option reserve within equity.
non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at the end of each reporting period so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognized over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
as long as all non-market vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
the cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
4. significant accounting policies continued r share-based payments continued where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period.
s borrowing costs borrowing costs attributable directly to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets which require a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
income earned on temporary investments of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on those assets is deducted from borrowing costs capitalised.
all other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
tonnes foreign currency in preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that entity foreign currencies are recorded in the respective functional currency i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates at the rates of exchanges prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
at the end of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined.
non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which cases, the exchange differences are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
for the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the group's entities are translated into the presentation currency of the group i.e. hong kong dollar using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period.
income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case, the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions are used.
exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of exchange fluctuation reserve attributable to non-controlling interests as appropriate . 4. significant accounting policies continued u related parties a a person or a close member of that person's family is related to the group if that person: i has control or joint control over the group; ii has significant influence over the group; or iii is a member of key management personnel of the group or the company's parent.

5. key sources of estimation uncertainty in the application of the group's accounting policies, which are described in note 4, the directors of the company are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
actual results may differ from these estimates.
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
a estimated write-downs of properties under development and completed properties for sale the group writes down properties under development and completed properties for sale to net realisable value based on assessment of the realisability of properties under development and completed properties for sale.
the group engages independent and qualified professional valuer to perform the valuation of properties under development and completed properties for sale for determining the net realisable value.
in addition, in determining the net realisable value, the group has estimated the costs to completion of properties under development based on current cost data and past experience and the net sales value based on past experience and prevailing market conditions.
if there is an increase in cost to completion or a decrease in net sales value, the net realisable value will decrease and this might result in write-downs of properties under development and completed properties for sale to net realisable value.
write-downs are recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying balances of the pertinent assets may not be realised at the amount as stated.
the identification of write-downs requires the use of judgements and estimates.
if there is a change in the events on circumstances resulting in changes to the original estimations used in determining net realisable value, it will impact the carrying value and write-downs of properties under development and completed properties for sale in the period in which such a change has occurred.
the carrying amounts of properties under development and completed properties for sale as at 31 march 2022 were hong kong dollar484,730,000 2021: hong kong dollar1,339,330,000 and hong kong dollar305,212,000 2021: hong kong dollar317,542,000 respectively.
5. key sources of estimation uncertainty continued b deposits for future acquisition of land use rights the group determines whether or not the deposits paid for acquisition of land use rights or for property development for sale purpose are impaired.
deposits paid to independent third parties, both secured and unsecured, are based on the agreed terms as stipulated in the relevant agreements.
impairment losses are recognised for the deposits when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the pertinent acquisition may not be completed and the deposits are not recoverable.
the management has delegated a business team responsible for monitoring progress of the acquisition and to safeguard the value of the deposits.
in the event that the recoverable amount from the land use rights to be acquired is identified and assessed to be less than the carrying amount of the deposits paid, impairment losses are recognised.
the carrying amount of deposits for future acquisition of land use rights included in prepayments, deposits and other receivables as at 31 march 2022 was hong kong dollar3,799,283,000 2021: hong kong dollar3,379,987,000 . further details are set out in note 26. c estimated impairment of receivables the measurement of impairment losses under hkfrs 9 across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk.
these estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances.
at the end of each reporting period, the group assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life between the reporting date and the date of initial recognition.
the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort for this purpose.
this includes quantitative and qualitative information and also, forward-looking analysis.
as at 31 march 2022, amounts due from associates and a joint venture amounted to hong kong dollar363,816,000 2021: hong kong dollar360,682,000 and other receivables amounted to hong kong dollar2,072,664,000 2021: hong kong dollar3,462,179,000 . d recognition and allocation of construction cost on properties under development development costs of properties are recorded as properties under development during construction stage and will be transferred to completed properties for sale upon completion.
an apportionment of these costs will be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income upon the recognition of the sale of the properties.
prior to the final settlement of the development costs and other costs relating to the sale of the properties, these costs are accrued by the group based on progress of construction and are assessed by the management.
in developing properties, the group may divide the development projects into phases.
specific costs directly related to the development of a phase are recorded as the costs of such phase.
costs that are commonly shared amongst different phases are allocated to individual phase in proportion based on the estimated saleable area of each phase.
5. key sources of estimation uncertainty continued d recognition and allocation of construction cost on properties under development continued where the final settlement of the costs and the related cost allocation base are different from the initial estimates, such variations would affect the profit or loss in future years for absorbing such cost variances when arose.
e lat prc lat is levied on the appreciation of land value, being the proceeds from the sales of properties less deductible expenditure including land cost, borrowing costs and all property development expenditure.
the subsidiaries of the company engaging in property development business in the prc are subject to lat charges, which will be included in the tax expenses.
however, the implementation of lat varies amongst various prc cities and the group has yet to finalise certain of its lat returns with various tax authorities.
accordingly, a significant judgement is required in determining the amount of land appreciation and its related chargeable taxes.
the ultimate lat determination is uncertain which is a common circumstance which exists in the ordinary course of property development business in the prc.
the group recognises the lat liabilities based on management's best estimates.
where the final outcome of these lat matters is different from the amounts that were estimated and recorded, such differences will impact on the tax expense and provision for lat included in the tax payable in the period in which such determination is made.
6. segment information the group's operating businesses are structured and managed separately, according to the nature of their operations and the products and services they provide.
operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly reviewed by the board of directors of the company, being the chief operating decision maker the “codm” in order to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
no operating segment identified by the codm has been aggregated in arriving at the reportable segments of the group.
summary details of the group's reportable and operating segments are as follows: the property development segment engages in the development of properties for sale in the prc; the property investment segment invests in commercial and residential properties located in the prc for their rental income potential and/or for capital appreciation; the project management services segment engages in the provision of project management services in the prc; and the project investment services segment engages in the provision of investment services in relation to investment in and sale of property development/land development projects in the prc.

the risks associated with these financial instruments include market risk currency risk and interest rate risk , credit risk and liquidity risk.
the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below.

5% 2021: 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
the sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the end of the reporting period for a 5% 2021: 5% change in foreign currency rates.
a positive number below indicates a decrease in loss 2021: decrease in loss for the year where renminbi strengthens against the relevant foreign currencies.

the group is also exposed to cash flow interest rate primarily in relation to variable-rate bank and other borrowings.
the group's cash flow interest rate is mainly concentrated on the fluctuation of libor, hibor and pboc prescribed interest rate arising from the group's united state dollar, hong kong dollar and renminbi denominated borrowings.
the management considers the exposure to interest rate risk in relation to pledged bank deposits and bank balances is insignificant due to the low level of bank interest rate.
during the year, the group has not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge against its cash flow and fair value interest rate risk.
however, the management will consider hedging significant interest rate exposure should the need arose.
sensitivity analysis the following table details the group's sensitivity to a 100 basis points 2021: 100 basis points increase and decrease in libor, hibor and pboc prescribed interest rate.
100 basis points are the sensitivity rate used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
the sensitivity analysis includes only variable-rate bank and other borrowings assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year.
a positive number below indicates an increase in loss where the interest rate increases.
if the interest rate decreases, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the loss for the year.
in the management's opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the interest rate risk as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
