the group recorded a net loss of s$2.38 million in fy2022.
this is mainly attributed to fewer contracts secured in our management consultancy services and corporate advisory services.
in addition to securing fewer contracts, the losses incurred by the group were also due to the recognition of expected credit loss allowance on financial assets amounting to s$1.10 million.

annual report 2022 forise international limited 03 statement by directors as we move into the financial year ending 31 december 2023 “fy2023”, while the issues surrounding the covid-19 pandemic are largely under control, we expect the overall business environment to remain challenging, with uncertainties, such as the prolonged russia-ukraine war, the ongoing trade tensions between usa and china, rising interest rates and persistent inflation, which pan out globally.
on the other hand, the recent steps that china has taken to relax its zero-covid policies and border measures are positive signals that china is reopening its economy.
the group continues to strive in our current businesses and will continue to do our best to explore new business opportunities in asia pacific.

on behalf of the board of directors mr.
peng wei leo executive director financial highlights net loss s$ 2.38m loss before tax s$ 2.38m revenue s$ 0.32m net assets value s$ 3.27 cents operating cash outflows s$ 0.84m shareholders' equity s$ 1.15m losses per share basic & diluted s$ 3.81 cents financial review the group's revenue for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 "fy2022" amounted to s$0.32 million, which is a decrease of s$1.37 million compared to the s$1.69 million recorded in fy2021.
the significant decrease is mainly attributed to fewer new contracts secured in our management consultancy services and corporate advisory services business.
in fy2022, the group had recognised an expected credit loss allowance on financial assets amounting to s$1.10 million, which was not recorded in fy2021.
this is primarily due to the slow collection of trade and other receivables caused by receivables liquidity and credit assessment continuing to deteriorate as a result of the uncertain economic situation.
employee compensation increased to s$1.08 million in fy2022, a rise of s$0.1 million from s$0.98 million in fy2021.
in fy2022, there was a higher reduction rate of 28% - 35% on director and staff costs.
however, the reduction rate was decreased to 15% to 20% in fy2022, leading to higher employee compensation during the financial year.
the reduction in director's remuneration and staff costs were due to the cost containment strategy implemented by the management to mitigate the group's reduced operating activities.
the group incurred a net loss on foreign exchange of s$0.1 million in fy2022, due to the fluctuation of chinese renminbi "renminbi" and united states dollar "united states dollar" against singapore dollar "s$".
however, this loss was partly offset by the decrease in the tax expense of s$0.001 million in fy2022, compared to s$0.07 million in fy2021.
the decrease in tax expense was mainly due to companies within the group incurring significantly more losses during the financial year.
as a result of the above factors, the group recorded net loss after tax of s$2.38 million in fy2022.
financial position as at 31 december 2021, the group's total assets saw a significant decrease of s$2.33 million from s$3.88 million in fy2021 to s$1.55 million in fy2022.
the decrease was primarily due to an expected credit loss allowance provided during the financial year.
this was caused by the slow collection of trade and other receivables as receivables liquidity and credit assessment continued to deteriorate due to the uncertain economic situation, resulting in the decrease of trade and other receivables from s$1.56 million in fy2021 to s$0.10 million in fy2022.
in addition, the group's cash and cash equivalents decreased by s$0.85 million from s$2.27 million in fy2021 to s$1.42 million in fy2022, primarily due to the net cash outflow from operating activities.
on the other hand, the total liabilities decreased by s$0.05 million from s$0.45 million in fy2021 to s$0.40 million in fy2022.
the decrease was mainly due to the absence of tax payable as the companies within the group incurred losses during the financial year.
however, this decrease was offset by an increase in the accrued expenses.
as a result of the above, the total shareholders' equity decreased from s$3.43 million in fy2021 to s$1.15 million in fy2022.
cash flows the group's cash and cash equivalents decreased by s$0.85 million from s$2.27 million as at 31 december 2021 to s$1.42 million as at 31 december 2022, primarily as a result of the net cash outflow from operating activities.

sustainability report environmental based on the group's operating scope, our business operations have very limited impact towards the environment.
however, we always strive to avoid unnecessary impact on the environment and to further reduce environmental impact.
our efforts are mainly focused towards minimising our energy usage.
climate change mitigation and adaptation climate risk considerations have stood out as a critical aspect of business continuity that needs to be addressed.
through the adoption of the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures framework, we assess the impact of key climate-related risks and opportunities and disclose climate action strategy under four overarching elements, including governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets.
governance we have established a robust governance structure as described in the “board statement” section.
the board oversees the group's sustainability in the formulation of its strategy and approves the disclosures on the group's climate-related risks and opportunities and its responding actions to enhance climate resilience.
under the board's delegations, the management is responsible for implementing and integrating relevant mitigation and adaptation measures into the group's operations.
strategy we acknowledge that climate change brings risks and opportunities to our business.
to strengthen our understanding of the climate-related issues, the group has incorporated climate risk into its erm process and strives to keep abreast of the latest trends in climate adaptation and mitigation through stakeholder engagement.
the group has actively taken the following measures in response to the potential risks and opportunities.
risk management physical risks since the group has adopted flexible working arrangements in its rented offices, the disruption to its routine business operations and the corresponding financial impact caused by extreme weather events is minimal.
for the safety of its employees, the group will closely monitor the latest weather news and provide guidance on the working arrangement when required according to the suggestions issued by the local authorities.
transition risks local governments have been accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.
the development of international policies and regulations on climate change may therefore pose potential transition risks to the group.
the group may have to incur higher operating costs to comply with the regulatory changes.
failure to meet climate change compliance requirements may expose the group to the risk of claims and litigation, which may result in a possible loss of corporate reputation.
the group will regularly monitor existing and emerging climate-related trends to avoid reputation risks due to slow response.
we will also pay attention to policies and regulations and obtain compliance advisory services when necessary.
the group intends to maintain high transparency in sustainability reporting and its related activities which establishes trust and confidence in its relationship with investors and customers.
metrics and targets the group follows the best practice of enhancing energy-efficiency and complies with related environmental laws and regulations.
relevant targets and measures on climate change and energy-saving can be found in the below section headed "energy and emission management".
sustainability report energy and emissions management we recognise the importance of combating the effects of climate change.
based on our business activities and model however, the group is minimally involved in environmentally impactful activities or activities with high energy consumption.
the group does not consume fuel directly from either renewable or non-renewable sources, therefore it does not generate any air emissions and direct scope 1 greenhouse gas greenhouse gas emissions.
the group only consumes electricity for its daily operations.
as the utility expenses were included in the management fee of the rented share offices, relevant energy consumption data and energy indirect scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are not available.
nonetheless, the group remains committed to enhance energy efficiency.
we encouraged employees to practise energy saving initiatives, including but not limited to: - using energy only when needed for example, turning off the lights when not in use, - installing led energy-saving bulbs, and - maintaining operation of air-conditioner at 25°c.
starting from fy2023, we will disseminate email messages related to energy conservation and climate change annually to raise awareness among employees, in an attempt to fulfil our commitment with the contribution of all employees.
supplier environmental assessment the group strives to monitor its environmental impact and encourages its stakeholders, such as service partners and trading partners, to meet the same expectations.
we ensure that all new suppliers are screened and selected with taking into consideration of environmental criteria and have been using reputable mid-tier companies that are environmentally friendly.
to meet the expectation of our clients, we conduct regular assessments of our key service providers to ensure that they all comply with anti-child labour laws and avoid the use of non-eco-friendly materials.
when necessary, the group will request key service providers to present their policies on monitoring and managing eesg issues including environmental protection, ethics, training, and to report any cases of non-compliance with environmental or safety laws.
in fy2022, none of our key service providers were identified as having significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts.
sustainability report social diversity and equal opportunity we embrace diversity, and at the same time expect employees to be aligned with the group's vision and strategic initiatives.

we believe that these benefits attract talent retention, which can create a positive work environment and help strengthen employees’ commitment to the group.

there have been no work-related fatalities, high-consequence work-related injuries and recordable work-related injuries for fy2022 fy2021: nil and we target to maintain the record for fy2023.
training and education forise understands that there is a continuous need to upgrade staff skills and knowledge.
this is beneficial to the staff development and also to the group.
thus, staff are encouraged to go for courses and seminars to keep themselves updated of the latest rules and regulations and the market investment trends.
all directors have undergone an average of 4 hours of training per employee training on sustainability matters as prescribed by the sgx-st.
there is no training given to employees in fy2022 as the group reduces training programmes to our employees per year to ensure the adequate level of training for their scope of work.
our target for fy2023 is to increase the average hours of training per employee of training to 10 hours of training per employee per employee due to the covid-19 pandemic.
the group will strive to provide training due course in the coming years.
customer privacy protection the group complies with relevant laws and regulations concerning customer privacy and endeavours to protect the personal data from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure.
the group has stipulated relevant rules in the employee code of conduct policy to ensure that the employees who handle customers' personal data and complaint data respect the confidentiality of such personal data and privacy, and handle with care to ensure customer privacy.
during fy2022, the group has received no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and identified no leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data.
we target to maintain this record for fy2023.
supporting local communities the group recognises the importance in being socially responsible and strives to give back to society in a positive and meaningful way.
the group considers ways of supporting communities in which it operates through charitable donations and participating corporate social responsibility "csr" activities, such as reaching out to the less fortunate and extending a helping hand to them.
unfortunately, due to the continuous outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in fy2022, as well as the various measures imposed to contain the spread of the virus such as social distancing, restriction of visits, limited size gathering and others, the group had to suspend its csr projects temporarily until the pandemic tides over.
however, the group intends to continue supporting various community projects once it is able, to do our part to contribute to society and the environment.

board matters continued 1.1 the board’s conduct of affairs continued director development/training continued a new director appointed to the board who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to the induction programme above, will be required to attend specific modules of the listed entity director “led” programme conducted by the singapore institute of directors “sid” in order to acquire the relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, which is a mandatory requirement under the listing rules of the sgx-st, unless the nc is of the view that such training is not required because the director has other relevant experience.
the training will cover the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company, which includes relevant areas such as accounting, legal knowledge and compliance, and will integrate into their new roles, as required by sgx-st.
all directors have duly completed their sid and sustainability reporting training as at the date of this report, and the group's culture, to enable them to direction and policies, key business risks, governance practices and all directors are also briefed and provided with regular updates on pertinent business developments, as well as developments in areas such as corporate governance, commercial risks, changes to laws and regulations pertaining to the group’s business and operations, and changes in financial reporting standards, so as to enable them to properly discharge their duties as board members.
the group sponsors relevant courses and seminars for new and existing directors in issues beyond basic director’s duties and liabilities.
our directors, from time to time, attend appropriate courses, conferences and seminars.
the board encourages the directors to continually develop and refresh their professional knowledge and skills, and to keep themselves abreast of relevant developments in the group’s business and the regulatory and industry-specific environments in which the group operates. 1.2 board composition and guidance principle 2: the board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.
as at the date of this annual report, the board has four directors, comprising two executive directors and two independent non-executive directors.
as two out of four members of the board are independent directors, there is a strong independent element on the board and no individual or group of individuals dominate the board’s decision-making process.
the board recognises that this departs from the requirements of provisions 2.2 and 2.3 of the code, which stipulate that independent directors must make up a majority of the board where the chairman is not identified a suitable candidate to be appointed to the board as an independent non-executive director the "proposed new director", subject to the approval of shareholders at the upcoming agm.
shareholders may refer to pages 114 to 119 of this annual report for more information on the proposed new director as required by appendix 7.4.1 of the listing manual.
corporate governance report 1.
board matters continued 1.2 board composition and guidance continued directors’ independence the independence of each director is reviewed annually by the nc in accordance with the code.
under the code, a director is considered independent if he is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, substantial shareholders holding not less than 5% of the total shareholding of the company or its officers that could interfere or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement in the best interests of the company.
the board considers the existence of relationships or circumstances, including those identified by the listing manual and the code’s practice guidance, that are relevant in its determination as to whether a director is independent.
such relationships or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a the employment of a director by the company or any of its related corporations during the current or any of the past three financial years; b a director being on the board for an aggregate period of more than nine years; c the acceptance of services from the company or any of its subsidiaries significant payments for board service; and d a director being a substantial shareholder, executive officer or director of any organisation which provided to or received during the current or previous financial year, other than compensation or material services during the current or immediate past financial year.
any director who has an interest or relationship which is likely to impact their independence or conflict with a subject under discussion by the board is required to immediately declare their interest or relationship to the board.
the directors complete an annual declaration of independence, whereby they are required to assess their independence having taken into account the above requirements, which they then put to the nc for review.
the two independent directors have confirmed their independence and that they do not have any interest in or any business or other relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to, interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment with a view to the best interests of the group.
neither of them has been on the board for an aggregate period of more than nine years.
following its annual review, the board and the nc are of the view that mr siow chee keong and mr lee ah too have, at all times, discharged their duties with professionalisms and objectivity, and exercised strong independent judgment in the best interests of the company.
for the above reasons, the nc is of the view that the two independent directors are independent in accordance with the definition of independence in the code.
when the board requires new independent directors to be elected to the board, the nc will first identify and recommend candidates to the board, which then considers the views of the nc prior to determining whether the director is independent in conduct, character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director’s judgement.
corporate governance report 1.
board matters continued 1.2 board composition and guidance continued directors' independence continued as at the date of this annual report, the company does not currently have a chairman, and independent directors make up half the board.
under the code, provision 2.2 requires independent directors to make up a majority of the board where the chairman is not independent; further, the company is required under provision 3.3 to appoint a lead independent director to comply with the requirement where the chairman is conflicted.
while the company is actively seeking to appoint a new independent director to comply with provision 2.2, it is of the view that notwithstanding not having appointed any lead independent director, the intent of provision 3.3 is fulfilled by reason of the board having a chairman and half the board members comprising independent directors who discuss matters robustly and present a strongly independent judgment in the best interests of the company's stakeholders.
in this way, there is no person who can dominate the board's decision-making process, and objectivity on matters under deliberation is assured.
the independent directors also provide oversight on management's performance by constructively challenging and helping to develop proposals on strategy.
they regularly meet without the presence of management to review the effectiveness and performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, after which feedback is provided to management.
nevertheless, the company is committed towards continuous development and improvement, and therefore remains open to the possibility of appointing a chairman and/or lead independent director in the future if it deems suitable or appropriate.
the company currently has no independent directors who have served on the board beyond nine years.
board diversity the company has a formal board diversity policy which endorses the principle that its board should have a balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of perspectives appropriate to its business so as to mitigate against groupthink and to ensure that the group has the opportunity to benefit from all available talents.
in reviewing board composition, the nc considers the benefits of all aspects of diversity, including diversity of background, experience, gender, age and other relevant factors.
these differences will be considered in determining the optimum composition of the board and where possible should be balanced appropriately.
the current board composition reflects the company's commitment to board diversity.
every year, the nc conducts its review of the composition of the board, which comprises members of both genders and from different backgrounds whose core competencies, qualifications, skills and experiences, meet with the requirements of the group at the point in time.
each director has been appointed on the strength of his calibre, experience and stature and is expected to bring a valuable range of experience and expertise to contribute to the development of the group strategy and the performance of its business.
in addition, the board consist of directors with ages ranging from early 40s to late 60s, who has served on the board for different tenures.
the board members with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the group's business and direction.

board matters continued 1.2 board composition and guidance continued board diversity continued the nc will continue to review the board diversity policy, as appropriate, to ensure its effectiveness, and will recommend the appropriate revisions to the board for consideration and approval.
it will also continue its identification and evaluation of suitable candidates to ensure there is diversity on the board.

role of the chairman and chief executive officer the company currently does not have a chairman or chief executive officer "ceo".
the responsibilities of the group's business and executive decisions are undertaken by the two executive directors, mr.
peng weile and mr.
wan jinn woei, who carry out the overall management, strategic development, and day-to-day operations of the group's business.
corporate governance report 1.
board matters continued 1.3 chairman and chief executive officer continued role of the chairman and chief executive officer continued the executive directors bear responsibility for ensuring that all directors and management work together with integrity and competency.
they are responsible for, amongst other things, ensuring that board meetings are held when necessary, facilitating sufficient quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the board and management, assisting in ensuring the group’s compliance with corporate governance regulations and maintaining regular dialogues with the management on all operational matters.
in particular, mr.
peng weile has, since his appointment to the board in august 2015, been responsible for the management of the group as well as for executing all strategic directions set by the board, and therefore has a keen understanding of the group's activities, strengths and capabilities.
as a member of the board and the senior management team, mr.
peng weile has always been actively involved with decision-making and the corporate plans, policies and executive decisions of the group since recently joining the company in august 2022, and is contributing towards the group's direction and growth in the regional market.
both executive directors are committed towards pursuing high standards of corporate governance and regularly interact with the board and management to ensure timely and adequate information flow.
as the company is managed objectively on a transparent basis, with all major decisions subject to a majority approval of the board and currently, half the board is made up of independent directors, there is no concentration of power in any one or a few select individuals on the board.
given the foregoing and taking into account the size, corporate structure, nature and scope of the group’s operations, amongst others, the nc and the board are of the view that notwithstanding the company not having a chairman or ceo, the process of decision-making by the board is based on collective decisions without any one individual or group having unfettered or concentrated powers of influence.
appointment of independent chairman and/or lead independent director provision 3.3 of the code provides that a lead independent director should be appointed to provide leadership in situations where the chairman is conflicted, and especially where the chairman is not independent.
as the group has not elected a chairman, the board size is small comprising four directors and half the board consists of independent directors, the board is of the view that the appointment of a lead independent director is not necessary at the moment.
further, the board and management have always responded to queries raised by shareholders in a timely manner and have been and will always remain accessible to shareholders.
the absence of a lead independent director has not impacted and is unlikely to impact the process of objective decision-making by the board, nor has it impacted and is unlikely to impact shareholders’ accessibility to information and responses to queries from the board.
nevertheless, the board will continue to periodically examine the need to appoint a lead independent director from.
if a lead independent director is appointed, the company will, in accordance with the code, ensure that he or she remains available to shareholders where they have concerns.

multiple directorships the nc has reviewed the contribution by each director, by considering whether each director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his duties as a director of the company, taking into account their listed company board representations and other principal commitments.
in addition, the nc will also take into consideration, amongst other things, a qualitative assessment of each director’s contributions as well as any other relevant time commitments.
the nc has considered and taken the view that it would not be meaningful to set a limit on the number of listed company directorships that a director may hold because directors have different capabilities, the nature of the organisations in which they hold appointments and the kind of committees on which they serve are of different complexities.
accordingly, each director would personally determine the demands of his competing directorships and obligations and assess the number of directorships they could hold and serve effectively.
in any case, the nc notes that none of the directors hold five or more listed company directorships.
notwithstanding the number of listed company board representations and other principal commitments which some of the directors are holding, the nc, having reviewed each director’s attendance, participation and contribution, is of the view that sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the company has been given by these directors and is satisfied that all directors have discharged their duties adequately for fy2022.
in addition, each director has confirmed that notwithstanding other listed company board representations and other principal commitments if any, he is able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the group.
the nc and the board will continue to review from time to time the listed company board representations and other principal commitments of each director to ensure that the directors continue to meet the demands of the company and are able to discharge their duties adequately.
alternate directors there are no alternate directors appointed.

independent auditor’s report to the members of forise international limited report on the audit of the financial statements opinion we have audited the accompanying financial statements of forise international limited the "company" and its subsidiary corporations the "group", which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 december 2022, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows of the group for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the group and the balance sheet of the company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 1967 in singapore the "act" and singapore financial reporting standards international "sfrsi", so as to give a true and fair view of the group's financial position as at 31 december 2022, of its financial performance for the financial year then ended, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the group for the financial year ended on that date.
basis for opinion we conducted our audit in accordance with singapore standards on auditing "ssas".
our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
we are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements of the accounting and corporate regulatory authority "acra".
code of professional conduct and ethics for public accountants and the acra code, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the acra code.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
key audit matters key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022.
these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
area of focus revenue recognition for the financial year ended 31 december 2022, the group's revenue amounted to sgd316,000.
revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
we focused on this area because revenue recognition has been identified as a significant risk in accordance with ssa 315 identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement and because of judgments used in sfrsi 15 - revenue from contracts with customers.
the revenue recognition is dependent on the terms and conditions of the contracts which requires management's judgement to identify the point of revenue recognition which would have a significant impact on the results of the group.
hence, we considered this as a key audit matter in our audit.
the accounting policy of the revenue recognition is disclosed on note 2.2 to the financial statements.
independent auditor’s report report on the audit of the financial statements continued key audit matters continued revenue recognition continued how our audit addressed the area of focus in obtaining sufficient audit evidence, we: - understood and evaluated the key controls over the sales cycles; - reviewed all significant contracts identified during the financial year and identified the performance obligations in the contracts; - determined the transaction price and where there are modifications to existing contracts that led to adjustment to revenue, reviewed any material changes to the transaction price; - evaluated management’s assessment of the application of sffrsi 15 and considered the appropriateness of the group’s revenue recognition accounting policies, including those related to accounting for variable consideration and contract modifications, vis-à-vis the requirements under sffrsi 15; and - performed substantive audit procedures, including sales cut-off procedures as at the financial year end to ascertain revenue is recognised appropriately in the correct financial year.
assessment of expected credit losses “ecl” on trade receivables area of focus as at 31 december 2022, the group had recorded trade receivables, net of ecl, amounting to sgd67,000, which represented 4% of the group’s total assets.
the group had recognised an ecl allowance on its trade receivables amounting to sgd1,044,000, which contributed 44% to the group’s loss before tax during the financial year ended 31 december 2022.
the basis of the ecl allowance for the trade receivables represents the management’s best estimates at the balance sheet date of ecl under sffrsi 9 financial instruments expected credit losses models.
management has assessed whether the credit risks of the trade receivables have increased significantly since their initial recognition, adopting the simplified approach for trade receivables to calculate their ecl.
management also assessed loss allowance using debtor specific assessment for credit impaired debtors.
the group considers historical and estimates of the amount and timing of the collectability of respective customers.
the management has separately identified a group of specific receivables which is either with repayment plan with the group or those which the group do not expect to receive future cash flows.
as the ecl assessment on trade receivables required significant management judgement and in consideration of the significance of trade receivables to the group, we determined this area to be a key audit matter.
the accounting policy of impairment of financial assets is disclosed on note 2.8b to the financial statements.

ii equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in profit or loss and its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss and its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses.
when the group’s share of losses in an associates equals to or exceeds its interest in the associates, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make, or has made, payments on behalf of the associates.
if the associates subsequently report profits, the group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
interest in an associates includes any long-term loans for which settlement is never planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
unrealized gains on transactions between the group and its associated companies are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the associated companies.
unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transactions provide evidence of impairment of the assets transferred.
the accounting policies of associated companies are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the group.
iii disposals investments in associated companies are derecognised when the group loses significant influence or joint control.
if the retained equity interest in the former associated company is a financial asset, the retained equity interest is remeasured at fair value.
the difference between the carrying amount of the retained interest at the date when significant influence or joint control is lost, and its fair value and any proceeds on partial disposal, is recognised in profit or loss.

summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.5 plant and equipment a measurement plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
the cost of an item of plant and equipment initially recognised includes its purchase price and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
b depreciation depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amounts over their estimated useful lives as follows: : , useful lives: : furniture and fitting and office equipment, useful lives: 3-5 years the residual values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
the effects of any revision are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise.
fully depreciated plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.
c subsequent expenditure subsequent expenditure relating to plant and equipment that has already been recognised is added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
all other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
d disposal on disposal of an item of plant and equipment, the differences between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss within “other income”. 2.6 investments in subsidiary corporations investments in subsidiary corporations are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses in the company’s balance sheet.

notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 2 summary of significant accounting policies continued 2.8 financial assets continued a classification and measurement continued debt instruments at subsequent measurement debt instruments mainly comprise of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other current assets excluding prepayments.
debt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost.
a gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at amortised costs and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired.
interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income using the effective interest rate method.
b impairment the group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt financial assets carried at amortised cost.
the impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
note 19b details how the group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
for trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by the sfrsi 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
for other receivables and deposits, the general 3 stage approach is applied.
credit loss allowance is based on 12 months expected credit loss if there is no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the assets.
if there is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, lifetime credit loss will be calculated and recognised.
c recognition and derecognition regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date - the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 19 financial risk management continued b credit risk continued iii trade receivables the group has applied the simplified approach to measure the lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables.
to measure the expected credit losses, the group has made debtor specific assessment for credit impaired debtors.
the group considers historical loss experience for the respective customers, and receipts with the group during the financial year and estimates separately the amount and timing of the collectability of respective cash flows.
the management has separately identified a group of specific receivables which is either with repayment plan with the group or those which the group do not expect to receive future repayments.
trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the group.
the group categorises a receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make contractual payment greater than 365 days past due based on historical loss rates for each category of customers and adjust to reflect current and forward-looking information.
where receivables have been written off, the group continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables due.
where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.
as at reporting date, the group has recognised an expected credit loss allowance of sgd1,044,000 2021: sgdnil against trade receivables over 365 days past due, because historical experience and forward-looking information has indicated that these group of receivables generally has a greater potential risk on the recoverability.
no other loss allowance is recognised as the management believes that the amounts that are past due are collectible, based on historical payment behaviour and credit-worthiness of the customers.
the movement of ecl on trade receivables are as follows: table: ecl on trade receivables : , 2022: , 2021: : beginning of financial year, 2022: –, 2021: – : allowance made, 2022: 1,044, 2021: – : currency translation differences, 2022: 28, 2021: – : end of financial year note 10, 2022: 1,016, 2021: – notes: this table provides a breakdown of the movement of expected credit loss ecl on trade receivables for the years 2022 and 2021.
notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 19 financial risk management continued b financial risk factors continued iv other financial assets, at amortised cost the group and the company's other financial assets recognised at amortised cost mainly consisted of cash and cash equivalents, non-trade receivables, loan to an associated company and deposits.
these other financial assets are subject to immaterial credit loss, except for loan to an associated company and other receivables due from subsidiary corporations.
in determining the ecl, management has taken into account the historical default experience and the financial position of the counterparties, adjusted for factors that are specific to these receivables in estimating the probability of default of each of these other financial assets.
for the purpose of impairment assessment, loss allowance is generally measured at an amount equal to 12-month ecl as there is low risk of default and strong capability to meet contractual cash flows.
when the credit quality deteriorates and the resulting credit risk of other financial assets increase significantly since its initial recognition, the 12-month ecl would be replaced by lifetime ecl.
other financial assets are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of other receivables to engage in a repayment plan with the group and the company, and a failure to make contractual payments.
as at the reporting date, the movements in credit loss allowances on other receivables and loans to associated company are as follows: table: group : , other receivables singapore dollar'000: , group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: , total singapore dollar'000: : beginning of financial year, other receivables singapore dollar'000: -, group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: 4,095, total singapore dollar'000: 4,095 : allowance made, other receivables singapore dollar'000: 58, group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: -, total singapore dollar'000: 58 : written-off, other receivables singapore dollar'000: -, group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: 4,095, total singapore dollar'000: 4,095 : currency exchange difference, other receivables singapore dollar'000: 3, group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: -, total singapore dollar'000: 3 : end of financial year note 10, other receivables singapore dollar'000: 55, group loan to an associated company singapore dollar'000: -, total singapore dollar'000: 55 table: company : , other receivables singapore dollar'000: , total singapore dollar'000: : beginning of financial year, other receivables singapore dollar'000: -, total singapore dollar'000: - : allowance made, other receivables singapore dollar'000: 899, total singapore dollar'000: 899 : end of financial year note 10, other receivables singapore dollar'000: 899, total singapore dollar'000: 899 notes: this table includes details on allowance made, written-off, and currency exchange difference.
notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 19 financial risk management continued c liquidity risk prudent liquidity risk management includes by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents note 9 to enable them to meet their normal operating commitments.
the group's and the company's financial liabilities are all due within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date and approximate the contractual undiscounted payments.
d capital risk the group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group's ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholder value.
in order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividend payment, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, obtain new borrowings or sell assets to reduce borrowings.
management monitors capital based on a gearing ratio.
the group and the company are not required by the banks to maintain financial ratios.
the group's and the company's strategies, which were unchanged from 2021, are to maintain gearing ratios of not more than 100%.
management will review the gearing ratios regularly based on operations and performance of the group.
the gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
net debt is calculated as any borrowings plus trade and other payables less cash and cash equivalents.
total capital is calculated as equity plus net debt.

notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 22 new or revised accounting standards and interpretations below are the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have been published, and are relevant for the group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023 and which the group has not adopted early.
a amendments to sfrsi 1-1 presentation of financial statements classification of liabilities as current or non-current effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023 the narrow-scope amendments to sfrsi 1-1 presentation of financial statements clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period.
classification is unaffected by the expectation of the entity or events after the reporting date e.
grams.
the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant.
the amendments also clarify what sfrsi 1-1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability, particularly for entities that previously considered management’s intentions to determine classification for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.
the group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.
b amendments to sfrsi 1-12 income taxes deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023 the amendments to sfrsi 1-12 income taxes require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences.
they will typically apply to transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations, and will require the recognition of additional deferred tax assets and liabilities.
the amendments should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
in addition, entities should recognise deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised and deferred tax liabilities associated with the earliest comparative period for all deductible and taxable temporary differences at the beginning of the earliest comparative period that are associated with: - right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and - decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities, and the corresponding amounts recognised as part of the cost of the related assets.
the cumulative effect of recognising these adjustments is recognised in retained earnings, or another component of equity, as appropriate.
sfrsi 1-12 did not previously address how to account for the tax effects of on-balance sheet leases and similar transactions and various approaches were considered acceptable.
some entities may have already accounted for such transactions consistent with the new requirements.
these entities will not be affected by the amendments.
the group does not expect any significant impact arising from applying these amendments.
notes to the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 23 events occurring after balance sheet date on 9 february 2023, the company announced that its subsidiary corporation, prisma technologies pte.
ltd.
