dear shareholders, on behalf of the board of directors, i am pleased to present the annual report and audited financial statements of transnational corporation plc, for the year ended 31 december 2022. 2022 was an extraordinary year in many ways, amid the conflict in ukraine, the continued impact of climate change and the ongoing consequences of the covid-19 pandemic.
the group navigated the challenging economic landscape successfully, implementing strategic initiatives that yielded significant improvements in our customer experience, enhanced our growth prospects, and delivered market share accretion and profitability during the year.
we achieved a record occupancy rate of 79% in our hospitality business and increased our average generation capacity in our power business, surpassing pre-pandemic revenue, earnings, and operational cash flow levels.
we also experienced commendable growth in trading profit, a strong earnings performance, and improved key metrics across all our businesses, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet.
these achievements were made possible by our clear strategy, service quality, professionalism, dedication, and the commitment displayed by colleagues throughout the group.
operating landscape during the year, the global economy was impacted by a series of events that have significantly complicated the ongoing recovery from the pandemic.
in nigeria, the annual inflation rate rose to a five-year high of 21.1%, and interest rates were at an all-time high of 16.5%, according to the central bank of nigeria.
uncertainty remains a significant feature in 2023 and the macro-environment will remain challenging.
in its latest world economic outlook, released on 30 january 2023, the international monetary fund upwardly revised its global growth forecasts for 2023, but highlighted the uncertainties caused by ongoing higher interest rates and the war in ukraine.
the imf predicted that the world would grow by 2.9% in 2023, below the rate of 3.4% recorded in 2022. the power sector in nigeria is improving under the oversight of the nigerian electricity regulatory commission nerc . in a bid to improve and sustain power generation, nerc introduced the partial activation of power purchase agreements ppas which came into effect from july 1, 2022. partial activation is a phased activation of the contracted capacities of gencos under the ppas between national bulk electricity trading company nbet and gencos.
this is a creative way that nerc has adopted to optimize the current low capacity of the national grid.
the hospitality sector rebounded in 2022, after two years of disruption caused by the pandemic.
the sector recorded 71.5% occupancy in 2022, this was on the back of improved business activities, boosted by the return of foreign leisure and business travellers, as well as increased corporate and government patronage.
notwithstanding the recent recovery, the sector faced significant challenges such as inflation, insecurity, elevated foreign exchange rates, and increasing energy costs, which impacted performance levels.
the world travel & tourism council has stated that the travel and tourism sector in nigeria is expected to create 2.6 million new jobs over the next decade, doubling the number of those employed within the sector by 2032. according to the report, nigeria's travel and tourism contribution to gdp is forecasted to grow at an average rate of 5.4% between 2022-2032, significantly outpacing the 3% growth rate of the overall economy.
we continue to see significant opportunity, both to grow our brands and to increase employment and drive formalisation of the sector.
as a global corporate citizen, with a purpose of improving lives and transforming africa, we are also making significant steps to improve our sustainability processes.

an engaged team we continued to prioritize diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
we recognize that diversity not only brings different perspectives and experiences, but it also leads to increased innovation and better decision-making.
our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace has resulted in a more engaged and motivated workforce.
we have implemented policies and practices to ensure that all employees feel valued and respected.
our efforts have helped us attract leading talent from diverse backgrounds and our employee satisfaction index increased significantly, with an over 80% average across the group.
we believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and we strive to create a work environment where they feel inspired and empowered to do their best work.
2023 outlook and priorities notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic climate, the board of directors and management team remain focused on delivering on our purpose and strategy to drive long-term value creation.
our strategy is matched with our mindset of positive transformation.
our priorities for 2023 are very clear: executing for today, planning for tomorrow.
in the power sector, we are focused on further increasing our generation capacity, taking into consideration the limitation in the transmission and distribution capacities.
to this end, four of our h25 generating turbines, which were strategically taken out of inventory for refurbishment during the year, will return to operation in 2023. these four turbines contribute about 100mw to our available capacity.
this, together with the improved gas supply, which we are aggressively pursuing, will provide a solid foundation for strong performance in 2023. we plan to further consolidate on the existing benefits from our membership of the west african power pool, by increasing our share of the regional electricity market.
in our energy division, development studies for opl 281 asset have been completed for the first phase of the development.
the asset will be developed in phases with the first phase comprising 2 wells.
our goal remains to achieve planned production in q4 of 2023. in line with the petroleum industry act pia , the process of voluntary conversion of the asset is currently ongoing and expected to conclude by q2, 2023. the pia replaces the former petroleum act and overhauls the previous regulation and governance of the oil and gas industry as it impacts upstream, midstream, and downstream petroleum operations.
it provides the option for holders of opl or oml to enter a voluntary conversion contract under the act.
the conversion from an opl or oml to the new regime respectively entitles the holder to benefit from the pia's favourable fiscal terms.
in the hospitality sector, our focus is on maximizing the potential of our existing assets, completing the transcorp events centre in abuja, a 5000-capacity purpose-built facility featuring state-of-the-art amenities which will serve as the leading venue to host medium to large scale events such as trade fairs, concerts, and weddings in our capital, implementing cost-saving strategies, upgrading facilities, and continuously improving customer experience.
a dual strategy of "exploring while developing", will be deployed in 2023 to expedite progress towards our end-of-year goal.
as a global corporate citizen, with a purpose of improving lives and transforming africa, we are also making significant steps to improve our sustainability processes.
i am proud to say, “we are transcorp, we improve lives and transform societies".
investor's toast as i reflect on the turnaround of our company, i am filled with a sense of pride and great accomplishment.
we have come a long way.
prior to the turnaround of our dear company, about 10 years ago, investors were offloading their shares at a ridiculous discount and there were hardly any buyers.
for years, the shares of the company traded flat, with no interest from the investing and general public.
today – we see a different trend and a resurgence of interest – which is an affirmation and recognition of the great turnaround we have achieved in the company and the shareholder value optimisation anchored in our group's philosophy of africapitalism.
acknowledgments in closing, i would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude and best wishes to my colleagues on the board, whose commitment and valuable counsel have propelled the group forward.
i congratulate our president/group ceo, dr. mrs. owen omogiafo, her subsidiary ceos – mr. christopher ezeafulukwe, mrs. dupe olusola, engr.
vincent ozoude, mr. peter ikenga, and the rest of the executive team for their excellent leadership, applaud the drive and commitment of all our colleagues that are instrumental in delivering the results set out in this report.
my appreciation also goes out to our valuable customers, business partners and all other critical stakeholders who have partnered and supported us in this exciting journey of growth.

group trading profit grew by 18%, increasing from n54.8 billion in 2021 to n66.6 billion in 2022. through all of this and like other companies globally, we contended with numerous adversities, including the lasting impact of the pandemic, economic uncertainty, fx shortages, insecurity, rising food costs, and inflation.
despite these challenges, we have delivered a robust performance, with most financial metrics ahead of pre-pandemic levels, optimized our existing assets, and unlocked value for our stakeholders as evidenced by the various corporate actions initiated during this financial year.
challenging operating environment the operating environment was challenging during the period, with several factors influencing our sectors: rising production costs due to global supply chain disruptions global and local commodity price volatility rising interest rate foreign exchange volatility rising inflation insecurity inadequate gas supply, poor transmission and distribution infrastructure, and liquidity challenges in the power sector.
in response to the challenging and, at times, volatile operating environment, we implemented several strategic initiatives across our various subsidiaries: power in the power sector, constant gas supply, poor transmission and distribution infrastructure, and liquidity challenges continue to impact nigeria's power generation capacity.
our power businesses – transcorp power limited and transafam power limited – navigated these challenges through strategic initiatives including: engagement with existing gas suppliers to ensure adequate gas supply to our power plants to enable optimum utilization of our plant capacity.
exploration and execution of contracts with new gas suppliers to diversify our supply base.
investment in increasing our available and generating capacity.
implementation of a strong predictive maintenance strategy to ensure we increase our efficiency.

limited angela aneke managing director 79 deloitte independent auditor's report to the shareholders of transnational corporation plc report on the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements opinion we have audited the consolidated and separate financial statements of transnational corporation plc and its subsidiaries the group and company set out on pages 79 to 150 , which comprise the consolidated and separate statements of financial position as at 31 december 2022, the consolidated and separate statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated and separate statements of changes in equity, consolidated and separate statements of cash flows for the year then ended and the notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
in our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated and separate financial position of transnational corporation plc as at 31 december 2022 , and its consolidated and separate financial performance and consolidated and separate statements of cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with international financial reporting standards, the requirements of the companies and allied matters act cama 2020 and financial reporting council act, 2011. basis for opinion we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing isas . our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
we are independent of the group and company in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants' iesba , international code of ethics for professional accountants including international independence standards iesba code and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements in nigeria.
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code and other ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of consolidated and separate financial statements in nigeria.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
key audit matter key audit matter is the matter that, in our professional judgment, was of most significance in our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements of the current year.
this matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on the matter.
making an impact that matters since 1845 the list of partners and partner equivalents is available in our office.
associate of deloitte africa, a member of deloitte touche tohmatsu limited.
key audit matter: assessment of goodwill impairment the group has a material balance of n30.934 billion as goodwill, which principally relates to the acquisition of transcorp power limited tpl and transcorp hotel plc thp . the asset is not amortized but tested for impairment annually.
goodwill is calculated as the difference between the purchase consideration and the share of net assets acquired; it is allocated to the cash generating units cgus thp and tpl.
in line with the provision of ias 36 – impairment of assets, goodwill should be tested for impairment annually.
the group tested goodwill for impairment and no impairment charge has been recorded against these balances in the current year.
the recoverable amount of thp has been determined using the fair value less costs to dispose approach.
to establish the fair value, the company engaged an external valuer who determined the fair value of the property, plant and equipment, based on several valuation assumptions and deemed the fair value of the other assets to be the same as their current carrying amount.
the recoverable amount of tpl has been determined using the value-in-use approach.
in determining the value in use, the group has estimated future cash flows, associated discount rates and growth rates based on their view of future business processes.
the current economic climate increases the complexity of forecasting.
scrutiny is placed on forecast assumptions and discount rates, with a greater focus on more recent trends and less reliance on historical trends.
the annual impairment test is significant to the audit because the balance involved is significant to the group and the testing process is complex and requires significant judgment made by the directors concerning the estimated value.
accordingly, the impairment test of goodwill is considered a key audit matter due to the impact of the above assumptions.
the disclosure of goodwill is set out in note 23 of the consolidated and separate financial statements.
how the matter was addressed in the audit to determine the appropriateness of the management assumptions and conclusions on the impairment assessment of the goodwill balance, in line with the provisions of ias 36, the following procedures were performed: we considered the determination of transcorp hotels plc and transcorp power limited as identifiable cash-generating units.
evaluated the appropriateness of the approaches – fair value and value in use method – used by management in determining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.
evaluated the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions the management expert used to estimate the fair value of the assets of transcorp hotels plc and transcorp power limited.
independently engaged a valuation expert who carried out a review on the valuation of the property, plant and equipment ppe of transcorp hotels plc to challenge management assumptions and methodologies used in determining the recoverable amount for the impairment testing.
agreed the balances for other operating assets and liabilities used in the fair value assessment to the audited financial statements of transcorp hotels plc.
reviewed management assumptions used to determine the estimated cost to dispose in respect of transcorp hotels plc.
compared the cash flows forecast to approved budgets and other relevant market and economic information as well as testing the underlying calculations used to estimate the value-in-use of transcorp power limited.
involved internal valuation specialists to assist in evaluating management’s key assumptions used in the estimation of transcorp power limited’s recoverable amount.
ensured appropriate disclosures in the financial statements.
based on the procedures performed, we believe the goodwill impairment assessment by the group is reasonable and the balance is not impaired.
other information the directors are responsible for the other information.
the other information comprises the directors’ report, corporate governance report, chairman’s statement, ceo’s reports, sustainability report, environmental, social & governance report, statement of directors’ responsibility and report of the statutory audit committee, which we obtained prior to the date of this report, and the annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date.
the other information does not include the consolidated and separate financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated and separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
if, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
we have nothing to report in this regard.
responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated and separate financial statements the directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards, the requirements of the companies and allied matters act 2020, the financial reporting council of nigeria act 2011 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group and/or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
we also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the company’s internal control.
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
deloitte's auditor's report conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated and separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
however, future events or conditions may cause the group and/or the company to cease to continue as a going concern.
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated and separate financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated and separate financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
report on other legal and regulatory requirements in accordance with the fifth schedule of companies and allied matters act cama 2020, we expressly state that: 1. we have obtained all the information and explanation which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of our audit.
2. the group has kept proper books of account, so far as appears from our examination of those books.
3. the group and company’s financial position and its statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are in agreement with the books of account and returns.

notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2022 accounting policies 1. corporate information the consolidated and separate financial statements of transnational corporation plc and its subsidiaries collectively, the group for the year ended 31 december 2022 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on february 24, 2023. transnational corporation plc the company or the parent is a public company incorporated under the companies and allied matters act cama on 16 november 2004, domiciled in nigeria and whose shares are publicly traded.
the registered office is located at 38 glover road, ikoyi, lagos, nigeria.
the major shareholder is uba nominees limited with 3,760,000 shares being 9.25% shareholding 2021: 9.26% . the group is principally engaged in the power, agro-allied, oil & gas, and hospitality industry.
information on the group's structure is provided in note 6. information on other related party relationships of the group is provided in note 43. 2. significant accounting policies 2.1 basis of preparation the consolidated and separate financial statements of the group have been prepared in compliance with the cama and in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and financial reporting council act 2021 as amended.
the consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties and equity financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
the consolidated and separate financial statements are presented in naira and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand n'000 , except when otherwise indicated.
the consolidated and separate financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous year.
2.2 going concern the directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
2.3 basis of consolidation the consolidated and separate financial statements comprise the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries as at 31 december 2022. control is achieved when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
specifically, the group controls an investee if, and only if, the group has: power over the investee i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control.
to support this presumption and when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the contractual arrangement s with the other vote holders of the investee rights arising from other contractual arrangements the group’s voting rights and potential voting rights consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the group loses control of the subsidiary.
the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated and separate financial statements from the date the group gains control until the date the group ceases to control the subsidiary.
profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income oci are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
when necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the group’s accounting policies.
all intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the group are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
if the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets including goodwill , liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.
any investment retained is recognized at fair value.
2.4 business combinations and goodwill business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
for each business combination, the group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
92 2.5 current versus non-current classification the group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current/non-current classification.
an asset is current when it is: expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle held primarily for the purpose of trading expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period or cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
all other assets are classified as non-current.
a liability is current when: it is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle it is held primarily for the purpose of trading.
it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period.
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
the group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
2.6 fair value measurement the group measures financial instruments such as equity financial assets, and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
the fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability the fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
the group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: level 1 — quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
level 3 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
for assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
management determines the procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as investment properties.

2.7 revenue from contracts with customers the group is principally engaged in the power, agro-allied, oil & gas and hospitality industry.
revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
the group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.
the group has applied the practical expedient in ifrs 15 to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics since the group reasonably expects that the accounting result will not be materially different from the result of applying the standard to the individual contracts.
the disclosures of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in note 3. at contract inception, the group assesses the goods or services promised to a customer and identifies as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: a good or service or a bundle of goods or services that is distinct; or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
in arriving at the performance obligations, the group assessed the goods and services as capable of being distinct and as distinct within the context of the contract after considering the following: if the customer can benefit from the individual good or service on its own; if the customer can use the good or service with other readily available resources; if multiple promised goods or services work together to deliver a combined output s ; and whether the good or service is integrated with, highly interdependent on, highly interrelated with, or significantly modifying or customizing, other promised goods or services in the contract.
revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
the group recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.
rooms contract for the rendering of service by providing a room for an agreed period begins on performance which is when a customer checks in.
the group recognizes revenue from the provision of room over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided to them.
the group uses an output method in measuring progress for the provision of room because time elapsed faithfully depict the entity's performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
the normal credit term is 30 to 90 days upon check-in.
food and beverages the group sells food and beverages to hotel guests and visitors.
a flat rate service charge is included in the consideration expected from the customer.
the group recognizes revenue from the sale of food and beverage is transferred to the customer.
energy and capacity charge capacity charge is recognized monthly based on the average of available capacity declared at the beginning of the month.
revenue from energy sent out is calculated on the basis of megawatts of electricity pushed to the transmission grid.
the capacity charge and energy sent out are included in revenue reported in the profit and loss account.
contract for the sale of electric power begins on performance and revenue is recognized overtime using an output method to measure progress towards completion of the service, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the group.
ancillary services ancillary services relate to services provided by the group, other than the primary production of electricity, which is used to operate a stable and secure power system including but not limited to reactive power, operating reserve, frequency control and black start capability.
the ancillary services are provided in line with the existing agreement.
the group recognises revenue from ancillary services over time as control is transferred.
other services the group generates revenue from other streams such as fitness club, laundry services, business centre, valet services.
revenue from rendering these services is recognised over time.
using an output method in measuring progress for the provision of the amenities because time elapsed, faithfully depict the entity's performance towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.
the normal credit term is 30 days upon check-in.
trade receivables a receivable represents the group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due . contract liability a contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the company has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer.
if a customer pays consideration before the company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due whichever is earlier . contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the group performs under the contract.
security deposit the group receives a refundable deposit from customers.
the refundable deposit is called a security deposit and the deposit is used to recoup unpaid balances owed by the customer.
however, if the customer does not have unpaid balances, the security deposit is refunded to the customer.
2.8 taxes current income tax current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the group operates and generates taxable income.
current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in profit or loss.
management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
deferred tax deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses.
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss.
deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in oci or directly in equity.
2.8 value added tax vat expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of value added tax vat , except: when the value added tax vat incurred on a purchase of an asset or service is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the vat is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.
when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of value added tax vat included.
the net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
2.9 foreign currencies the group's consolidated and separate financial statements are presented in naira, which is also the parent company's functional currency.
for each entity, the group determines the functional currency; and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
the group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation, the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method.
transactions and balances transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the group's entities at their respective functional currency spot rates, at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.
non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
the gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in oci or profit or loss are also recognized in oci or profit or loss, respectively . in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income or part of it on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration.
if there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
2.10 cash dividend the group recognizes a liability to pay a dividend when the distribution is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the company.
as per the corporate laws of nigeria, a distribution is authorized when it is approved by the shareholders.
a corresponding amount is recognized directly in equity.
2.11 property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are tangible assets which the group holds for its own use or for rental to others and which are expected to be used for more than one year.
an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost.
cost includes all of the expenditure which is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the asset, including the capitalization of borrowing costs on qualifying assets.
expenditure incurred subsequently for major services, additions to or replacements of parts of property, plant and equipment are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the group and the cost can be measured reliably.
day-to-day servicing costs are included in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.
property, plant and equipment is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, except for land which is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
depreciation of an asset commences when the asset is available for use as intended by management.
depreciation is charged to write off the asset's carrying amount over its estimated useful life to its estimated residual value, using a method that best reflects the pattern in which the asset's economic benefits are consumed by the group.
leased assets are depreciated in a consistent manner over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease term.
depreciation is not charged to an asset if its estimated residual value exceeds or is equal to its carrying amount.
depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale or derecognized.
construction in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses, if any.
other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the motor vehicle, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met.
depreciation of property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: table: depreciation method and average useful life item: buildings, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 50 years item: freehold land, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: not depreciated item: plant and machinery, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 0 to 50 years item: furniture and fixtures, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 5 to 10 years item: motor vehicles, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 4 to 5 years item: computer and office equipment, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 3 to 10 years item: leasehold improvements, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 5 to 10 years table end.
assets are depreciated when available for use.
an item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
leases the group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
that is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
in order to assess whether a contract is, or contains a lease, management determine whether the asset under consideration is "identified”, which means that the asset is either explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract and that the supplier does not have a substantial right of substitution throughout the period of use.
once management has concluded that the contract deals with an identified asset, the right to control the use thereof is considered.
to this end, control over the use of an identified asset only exists when the group has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset as well as the right to direct the use of the asset.
in circumstances where the determination of whether the contract is or contains a lease requires significant judgement, the relevant disclosures are provided in the significant judgments and sources of estimation uncertainty section of these accounting policies.
group as lessee the group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for its lease.
the group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
lease liability at the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.
the lease payments include fixed payments including in-substance fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.
the lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising the option to terminate.
variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.
in calculating the present value of lease payments, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.
after the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.
in addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments e.grams., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
right-of-use assets the group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use . right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.
the cost of right-of-use asset includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.
right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the asset.
depreciation of assets depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
table: depreciation details for office buildings item: office buildings, depreciation method: straight line, average useful life: 5 years table end.
if ownership of the leased asset transfers to the group at the end of the lease term, or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.
refer to the accounting policies on impairment of non-financial assets.
group as lessor leases where the group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases.
rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in profit or loss due to its operating nature.
initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.
contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
2.13 borrowing costs borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.
all other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
2.14 investment properties investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs.
subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the reporting date.
gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, including the corresponding tax effect.
fair values are determined based on an annual valuation performed by an accredited external independent valuer applying a valuation model recommended by the international valuation standards committee.
investment properties are derecognized either when they have been disposed of i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal.
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.
the amount of consideration to be included in the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of investment property is determined in accordance with the requirements for determining the transaction price in ifrs 15. transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use.
for a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of change in use.
if owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the group accounts for such property in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.
if an entity owns property that is leased to, and occupied by, another entity in the same group, the property does not qualify as investment property in the consolidated financial statements that include both entities.
this is because the property is owner-occupied from the perspective of the group as a whole.
however, from the perspective of the individual entity that owns it, the property is an investment property.
2.15 intangible assets intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
the cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition.
following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.
internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
the useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
the amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
the amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.
derecognition of intangible assets an intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in profit or loss.
goodwill with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.
the assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable.
if not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
computer software computer software acquisition costs recognized as assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the point at which the asset is ready for use.
the estimated useful lives of the software of the group is between three to eight years.
research and development research costs are charged to expense as incurred.
development expenses are capitalized when the following can be demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; its ability to use or sell the intangible asset; oil and natural gas exploration & evaluation, appraisal and development expenditure the group applies ifrs 6 “exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources” for exploration and evaluation costs.
oil and natural gas properties and expenditures are accounted for in accordance with the successful effort method of accounting sem . pre-license costs pre-license costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
license acquisition costs exploration license acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
this review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still underway or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is underway to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
if no future activity is planned, the carrying value of the license and property acquisition costs is written off through profit or loss.
upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and natural gas properties.
license costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalized and amortized over the term of the permit.
acquisition of producing assets upon acquisition of producing assets, where the group does not have control, the group identifies and recognizes the individual identifiable assets acquired including those assets that meet the definition of, and recognition criteria for, intangible assets in ias 38 intangible assets and liabilities assumed.
the purchase price paid for the group of assets is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase.
exploration and evaluation costs exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
once the legal right to explore has been acquired, costs directly associated with an exploration well are capitalized as exploration and evaluation intangible assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated.
these costs include directly attributable employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors.
geological and geophysical costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
if no potentially commercial hydrocarbons are discovered, the exploration asset is written off as a dry hole.
if extractable hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity e.grams., the drilling of additional wells , are likely to be capable of being commercially developed, the costs continue to be carried as an intangible asset while sufficient or continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the hydrocarbons.
costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset.
all such capitalized costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review as well as review for indicators of impairment at least once a year.
this is to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
when this is no longer the case, the costs are written off to profit or loss.
when proved reserves of oil and natural gas are identified and development is sanctioned by management, the relevant capitalized expenditure is first assessed for impairment and if required any impairment loss is recognized, then the remaining balance is transferred to oil and natural gas properties.
no amortization is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
for exchanges or parts of exchanges that involve only exploration and evaluation assets, the exchange is accounted for at the carrying value of the asset given up and no gain or loss is recognized in the profit or loss.
development expenditure expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells is capitalized within oil and natural gas properties.
2.16 financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
i financial assets initial recognition and measurement financial assets are classified at initial recognition as, amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income oci , and fair value through profit or loss.
financial assets measurement financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income oci , and fair value through profit or loss.
the classification at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the group's business model for managing them.
trade receivables not containing a significant financing component, or for which the practical expedient has been applied, are measured at the transaction price ifrs 15 . for an asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or fair value through oci, it must give rise to cash flows solely as payments of principal and interest sppi on the outstanding principal amount.
this is assessed at the instrument level.
the group's business model determines whether cash flows result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets, or both.
purchases or sales requiring asset delivery within a timeframe established by regulation or convention regular way trades are recognized on the trade date—when the group commits to the purchase or sale.
subsequent measurement financial assets are classified into four categories for subsequent measurement: financial assets at amortized cost debt instruments financial assets at fair value through oci, with recycling of cumulative gains and losses debt instruments financial assets designated at fair value through oci, with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition equity instruments financial assets at fair value through profit or loss financial assets at amortized cost debt instruments the group measures financial assets at amortized cost if: the asset is held within a business model to collect contractual cash flows; and contractual terms give rise to cash flows solely as payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount.
assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate eir method and are subject to impairment.
gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss upon derecognition, modification, or impairment.
this category includes trade receivables and receivables from other related parties.
financial assets designated at fair value through oci equity instruments upon initial recognition, the group may irrevocably classify equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through oci if they meet the ias 32 definition of equity and are not held for trading.
classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
gains and losses are never recycled to profit or loss.
dividends are recognized as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment is established, except when the group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the asset cost; in such cases, gains are recorded in oci.
these instruments are not subject to impairment assessment.
the group classifies its non-listed equity investments in this category.
derecognition a financial asset or part of one, or a group of similar assets is primarily derecognized removed from the consolidated statement of financial position when: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows, or assumed an obligation to pay received cash flows to a third party under a pass-through arrangement, and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of those risks and rewards, but has transferred control of the asset.
when rights to receive cash flows have been transferred or a pass-through arrangement is entered into, the group evaluates the extent to which it has retained risks and rewards of ownership.
if neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards, nor transferred control, the group continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement and recognizes an associated liability.
the transferred asset and associated liability are measured to reflect the rights and obligations retained.
continuing involvement taking the form of a guarantee is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount and the maximum amount the group could be required to repay.
impairment of financial assets further disclosures on impairment of financial assets are provided in the following notes.
disclosures for significant assumptions - note 3 trade receivables - note 29 the group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses ecls for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.
ecls are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.
the expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms if any . ecls are recognised in two stages.
for credit exposures for which there have not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ecls are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months a 12-month ecl . for those credit exposures for which there have been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default a lifetime ecl . for trade receivables and contract assets, the group applies a simplified approach in calculating ecls.
therefore, the group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date.
the group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
the group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
however, in certain cases, the group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the group.
a financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
ii financial liabilities initial recognition and measurement financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or payables, as appropriate.
all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
the group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
subsequent measurement the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
this category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by ifrs 9. separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in ifrs 9 are satisfied.
the group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
financial liabilities at amortised cost after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eir method.
gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process.
amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir.
the eir amortisation is included as finance costs in profit or loss.
gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.
this category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
for more information, refer to note 26. derecognition a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
when an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
iii offsetting of financial instruments financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.17 inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for, as follows: there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
no additional notes or footnotes were present besides those already included in the text.
2.18 impairment of non-financial assets further disclosures relating to impairment of non-financial assets are also provided in the following notes: disclosures for significant assumptions - note 3 property, plant and equipment - note 20 intangible assets - note 24 goodwill - note 23 the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
if any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group estimates the asset's recoverable amount.
an asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cgu's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
the recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
when the carrying amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
in determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.
if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
these calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
the group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the group's cgus to which the individual assets are allocated.
these budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.
a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
for assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased.
if such indication exists, the group estimates the asset's or cgu's recoverable amount.
a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 december and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cgu or group of cgus to which the goodwill relates.
when the recoverable amount of the cgu is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
2.19 cash and cash equivalent cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise of cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
2.20 provisions provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
when the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
the expense relating to a provision is presented in profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
if the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
when discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
2.21 pension and other post-employment benefits defined contribution scheme - pension the group operates a defined contribution plan for its staff in accordance with the provisions of the pension reform act 2014 as amended.
this plan is in proportion to the services rendered to the group by the employees with no further obligation on the part of the group.
each employee contributes 8% of annual earnings basic pay, transport and housing , while the employer contributes 10% to the scheme.
staff contributions to the plan are funded through payroll deductions while the group and company's contribution is recorded as employee benefit expense in profit or loss.
the group does not have any legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts if the plan asset is not sufficient to fund the obligation.
short term employee benefit the cost of short-term employee benefits, those payable within 12 months after the service is rendered, such as paid vacation leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits such as medical care , are recognised in the period in which the service is rendered and are not discounted.
a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the there are no tables or charts in the provided image.
there are also no images to replace with placeholders.
other long-term employee benefits the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period.
the projected unit credit puc method sometimes known as the accrued benefit method sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
the regular benefit expense for the year to be recognised in profit/loss is a result of: the cost of the additional benefits that members accrue during the year based on projected benefit at future payment date current service cost . plus net interest on the net liability: interest cost on the accrued defined benefit obligation interest income on the fair value of plan assets if any the amount recognised as a net benefit liability in the consolidated statement of financial position is: the deficit in the plan.
plus the effect of asset ceiling, if applicable.
any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset . actuarial gains and losses arising during the financial year.
return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset . any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset . amendments to plan, curtailments and settlements in the staff long service award lsa plan during the current financial year, there was no change made to the long service award lsa plan.
also, there were no material events, curtailment or settlements during the financial year.
2.22 deferred income deferred income is recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.
when the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs are expensed.
when the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
when the group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments.
2.23 profit-sharing and bonus plan the group operates a bonus plan where staff are remunerated based on parameters determined by the board.
bonus payments are at the discretion of the board and the expense is recognised in the year it is incurred.
there is no contractual obligation, neither has there been a past practice to create a constructive obligation.
3. significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 3.1 judgements in the process of applying the group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated and separate financial statements: determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options – group as lessee the group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
the group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease.
that is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.
after the commencement date, the group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate e.grams., construction of significant leasehold improvements . the group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of office building with shorter non-cancellable period i.e., less than two years . the group typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect on operations if a replacement asset is not readily-available.
furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term, only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.
property lease classification – group as lessor the group has entered into land property leases on its investment property portfolio.
based on an evaluation of the lease terms and conditions e.grams., lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the land property, and the present value of minimum lease payments not amounting to substantially all of the fair value of the land property , the group determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.
revenue from contracts with customers the group applied the following judgments that significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers: determining the timing of satisfaction the group concluded that revenue from energy and capacity supplied, rooms, and other services will be recognized over time because, as the group performs, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided.
the group determined that the output method is the best method for measuring progress while rendering services to the customer.
this method recognizes revenue based on direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.
the output method was also deemed best for measuring the progress of energy and capacity supplied, as it demonstrates that the invoiced amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the group's performance completed to date.
a direct relationship exists between the group's measurement of the value of goods or services transferred to date and the remaining goods or services promised under the contract.
revenue from selling food and beverages is recognized at a point in time because the sale does not meet the requirements of being satisfied over time.
a customer obtains control of the food and beverage when: the group has a present right to payment for the food and beverage; the group has transferred physical possession of the food and beverage to the customer; the customer has the significant risks and rewards of the food and beverage.
revenue earned from service charges will be recognized as the host good or service is being satisfied.
for rooms and other services, revenue earned from service charges will be recognized over time, in line with how revenue from rooms and other services are being recognized.
for food and beverage, revenue earned from service charges will be recognized at a point in time, in line with how revenue from food and beverage are being recognized.
principal versus agent considerations: hilton honours – customer loyalty program the group participates in the hilton honours customer loyalty program.
the program allows customers to earn points for nights spent at hotels.
accumulating sufficient points earns the customer a discount usable at any hilton hotel worldwide.
the group acts as an agent in the transaction, based on the following: the group is not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified benefit arising from earning loyalty points.
the group has no control of the loyalty program.
the group does not determine the cash value of the points earned by customers.
3.2 estimates and assumptions fair value of investment properties the group carries its investment properties at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
a valuation methodology based on depreciated replacement cost and the comparative method was used to arrive at the fair value of the land.
an independent valuation specialist assessed fair values as of december 31, 2022. key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the properties and sensitivity analyses are provided in notes 22. valuation basis the valuation basis for the investment property is the comparative method; that is, the price which an interest in a property might reasonably be expected to realize in a comparable property within the same area, assuming: a. a willing buyer; b. a reasonable period within which to negotiate the sale, taking into account the nature of the property and the state of the market; c. values will remain static throughout the period.
method of valuation we have valued the property in the open market using the direct market comparison method of valuation.
direct market comparison approach this approach compares a subject property's characteristics with those of comparable properties which have recently sold in similar transactions to arrive at the value.
the process uses one of several techniques to adjust the prices of the comparable transactions according to the presence, absence or degree of characteristics which influence value.
impairment of non-financial assets impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm's length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs of disposing of the asset.
the value in use calculation is based on a dcf model.
the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the performance of the assets of the cgu being tested.
the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the dcf model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
these estimates are most relevant to goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives recognised by the group.
the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cgus, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 23. provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets the group uses a provision matrix to calculate ecls for trade receivables and contract assets.
the provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns i.e., by product type, customer type and rating . the provision matrix is initially based on the group's historical observed default rates.
the group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.
for instance, if forecast economic conditions i.e., gross domestic product are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical default rates are adjusted.
at every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
the assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ecls is a significant estimate.
the amount of ecls is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions.
the group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.
the information about the ecls on the group's trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 29. measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial asset the measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost due from related companies is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour e.grams. the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses . explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ecl in note 29 is further detailed below, which also sets out key sensitivities of the ecl to changes in these elements.
the group uses a provision matrix to calculate ecls for trade receivables.
the provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns i.e.,by product type, customer type and rating . the provision matrix is initially based on the group's historical observed default rates.
the group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.
for instance, if forecast economic conditions i.e.,gross domestic product are expected to deteriorate over the next period which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical default rates are adjusted.
at every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward looking estimates are analysed.
the assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ecls is a significant estimate.
the amount of ecls is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions.
the group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.
taxes deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised,based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.
4. new standards and interpretations 4.1 standards and interpretations effective and adopted in the current year in the current year, the group has applied a number of amendments to ifrs accounting standards issued by the international accounting standards board iasb that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 january 2022. their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
amendments to ifrs 3 reference to the conceptual framework the group has adopted the amendments to ifrs 3 business combinations for the first time in the current year.
the amendments update ifrs 3 so that it refers to the 2018 conceptual framework instead of the 1989 framework.
they also add to ifrs 3 a requirement that, for obligations within the scope of ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, an acquirer applies ias 37 to determine whether at the acquisition date a present obligation exists as a result of past events.
note 23: further explanation of key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for different cgus, including sensitivity analysis note 29: further details on ecls on the group's trade and other receivables amendments to ias 16 property, plant and equipment—proceeds before intended use the group adopted the amendments to ias 16 property, plant and equipment for the first time in the current year.
these amendments prohibit deducting from the cost of an asset any proceeds from selling items produced before the asset is ready for use.
sales proceeds and related costs are recognized in profit or loss.
the entity measures the cost of these items according to ias 2 inventories.
the amendments clarify "testing whether an asset is functioning properly" as assessing if the asset's technical and physical performance allows its use in production, supply of goods or services, rental, or administrative purposes.
if not presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income, the financial statements will disclose the amounts of proceeds and costs included in profit or loss that relate to items not produced as part of the entity's ordinary activities, specifying which line item s in the statement of comprehensive income include these.
amendments to ias 37 onerous contracts—cost of fulfilling a contract the group adopted the amendments to ias 37 for the first time this year.
the cost of fulfilling a contract includes costs directly related to the contract.
these consist of incremental costs e.grams., direct labor or materials and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling contracts e.grams., depreciation of property, plant, and equipment . annual improvements to ifrs accounting standards 2018-2020 cycle the group adopted the amendments from the annual improvements to ifrs accounting standards 2018-2020 cycle for the first time this year.
these improvements include amendments to four standards.
ifrs 1 first-time adoption of international financial reporting standards the amendment provides additional relief to subsidiaries that become first-time adopters later than their parent regarding accounting for cumulative translation differences.
a subsidiary using the exemption in ifrs 1:d16 a can elect to measure cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations at the carrying amount included in the parent's consolidated financial statements, based on the parent's transition date to ifrs accounting standards.
this assumes no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures or the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary.
a similar election is available to an associate or joint venture using the exemption in ifrs 1:d16 a . ifrs 9 financial instruments the amendment clarifies that when applying the '10 per cent' test to determine whether to derecognize a financial liability, an entity includes only fees paid or received between the entity borrower and lender, including fees paid or received by either party on behalf of the other.
ifrs 16 leases the amendment removes the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements.
ias 41 agriculture the amendment removes the requirement in ias 41 for entities to exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value.
this aligns the fair value measurement in ias 41 with the requirements of ifrs 13 fair value measurement.
4.2 new and revised ifrs standards in issue but not yet effective as of the date of authorization of these financial statements, the group has not applied the following new and revised ifrs accounting standards, which are not yet effective: 1. ifrs 17 including the june 2020 amendments to ifrs 17 insurance contracts 2. amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture 3. amendments to ias 1 classification of liabilities as current or non-current 4. amendments to ias 1 and ifrs – disclosure of accounting policies 5. amendments to ias 8 definition of accounting estimates 6. amendments to ias 12 deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction the directors do not expect the adoption of these standards to materially impact the group's financial statements in future periods.
ifrs 17 insurance contracts ifrs 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts, superseding ifrs 4 insurance contracts.
amendments to ifrs 17 ifrs 17 outlines a general model, modified for insurance contracts with direct participation features variable fee approach . the general model simplifies if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining coverage using the premium allocation approach.
in june 2020, the board issued amendments to ifrs 17 to address concerns and implementation challenges.
these amendments defer the date of initial application of ifrs 17 incorporating the amendments to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023. the board also issued an extension of the temporary exemption from applying ifrs 9 in ifrs 4 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023. ifrs 17 must be applied retrospectively unless impracticable; otherwise, the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach is applied.
the effective date of the amendment will be determined by the iasb.
it is unlikely that this amendment will have a material impact on the group's consolidated and separate financial statements.
amendments to ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements and ias 28 investments in associates and joint ventures these amendments address situations involving the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture.
gains or losses resulting from the loss of control of a subsidiary not containing a business, and accounted for using the equity method in a transaction with an associate or joint venture are recognized in the parent's profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors' interests.
similarly, gains and losses from remeasurement of retained investments in any former subsidiary that became an associate or joint venture, accounted for using the equity method to fair value are recognized in the former parent's profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors' interests.
the effective date of the amendment will be determined by the iasb, but earlier application is permitted.
it's unlikely this amendment will materially impact the group's consolidated and separate financial statements.
amendments to ias 1 presentation of financial statements these amendments only affect the presentation of liabilities as current or non-current in the statement of financial position, not the amount or timing of recognition of any asset, liability, income, or expense, or the information disclosed.
changes to the definition of material are not expected to significantly impact the group's consolidated financial statements.
amendments to ias 1 & ifrs practice statement 2: disclosure of accounting policies these amendments change the requirements in ias 1 regarding disclosure of accounting policies, replacing "significant accounting policies" with "material accounting policy information".
information is considered material if it could reasonably influence decisions based on the financial statements when considered with other included information.
supporting paragraphs in ias 1 have been amended to clarify that accounting policy information relating to immaterial transactions, other events, or conditions is itself immaterial and need not be disclosed.
however, accounting policy information may be material due to the nature of the related transactions, other events, or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial.
the board has developed guidance and examples to explain and demonstrate application of the four-step materiality process described in ifrs practice statement 2. these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023, with earlier application permitted.
they are applied prospectively.
amendments to ifrs practice statement 2 do not have an effective date or transition requirements.
it is unlikely that these amendments will materially impact the group's consolidated and separate financial statements.
amendments to ias 8: accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors these amendments replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates.
accounting estimates are now defined as monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.
the definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted; however, the concept remains in the standard with these clarifications: a change in accounting estimate resulting from new information or new developments is not a correction of an error.
the effects of a change in an input or measurement technique used to develop an accounting estimate are changes in accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors.
the board added two examples examples 4-5 to the guidance on implementing ias 8 and deleted one example example 3 to avoid confusion.
the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2023 for changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates occurring on or after the beginning of that period, with earlier application permitted.
it is unlikely that this amendment will materially impact the group's consolidated and separate financial statements.
amendments to ias 12 income taxes these amendments introduce a further exception from the initial recognition exemption.
an entity does not apply the initial recognition exemption for transactions resulting in equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

capital risk management for the purpose of the group's capital management, capital includes issued capital, share premium and retained earnings attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
the primary objective of the group's capital management is to maximize the shareholder value.
the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the finance covenants.
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
the group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.
the group's policy is to keep the gearing ratio between 50% and 70%.
the group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and bank balances.
in order to achieve this overall objective, the group's capital management, among other things, aims to ensure that it meets finance covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
there have been no breaches of the finance covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
no changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year ended 31 december, 2022 and 2021. financial risk management credit risk credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a finance instrument or customer contract, leading to a finance loss.
the group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and finance institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other finance instruments.
the maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the table below: table not included in image table: group trade and other receivables and bank balances 2022 & 2021 category: trade and other receivables, gross carrying amount n'000 2022: 89,653,456, credit loss allowance n'000 2022: 7,012,329 , net carrying amount n'000 2022: 82,641,127, gross carrying amount n'000 2021: 74,950,903, credit loss allowance n'000 2021: 6,969,450 , net carrying amount n'000 2021: 67,981,453 category: bank balances, gross carrying amount n'000 2022: 9,332,636, credit loss allowance n'000 2022: -, net carrying amount n'000 2022: 9,332,636, gross carrying amount n'000 2021: 14,200,093, credit loss allowance n'000 2021: -, net carrying amount n'000 2021: 14,200,093 table end.

impairment of trade receivables an impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.
the provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns i.e., by geographical region, product type and customer type . the calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
the group's historical credit loss experience does not show significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments.
the provision for credit losses is therefore based on past due status without disaggregating into further risk profiles.
the loss allowance provision is determined as follows: table: trade receivables - group days past due 31-dec-22 days past due: current, expected credit loss rate: 1.6%, estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 7,345,680, expected credit loss n'000 : 120,254 days past due: <30 days, expected credit loss rate: 2.0%, estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 6,835,465, expected credit loss n'000 : 136,584 days past due: 30-60 days, expected credit loss rate: 2.2%, estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 8,324,560, expected credit loss n'000 : 184,355 days past due: 61-90 days, expected credit loss rate: 7.3%, estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 3,204,560, expected credit loss n'000 : 235,455 days past due: 91 days, expected credit loss rate: 10.1%, estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 62,649,310, expected credit loss n'000 : 6,335,681 days past due: total , estimated total gross carrying amount at default n'000 : 88,359,575 , expected credit loss n'000 : 7,012,329 table end.

risk management customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the group's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment.
outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance obtained from reputable banks and other finance institutions.
the board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
liquidity risk prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market management monitors, rolling forecasts of the group's liquidity reserve and cash and bank balances on the basis of expected cash flows.
this is generally carried out at each of the respective companies of the group in accordance with practice and limits set by the group.
these limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates.
in addition, the group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.
the group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans.
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
the group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the group's operating activities when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency . foreign currency balance : united states dollar, group 2022: 5,428,711, group 2021: 116,527, company 2022: 12,830, company 2021: 9,820 : gbp, group 2022: 129,787, group 2021: 1,932, company 2022: -, company 2021: - : euro, group 2022: 3,076, group 2021: -, company 2022: -, company 2021: - table end.
foreign currency sensitivity analysis the following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in united states dollar and gbp exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.
the impact on the group's profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities.
the group's exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
: change in united states dollar rate 2% 2021: 2% , group 2022 increase: 50,107,003, group 2022 decrease: 50,107,003 , group 2021 increase: 444,052, group 2021 decrease: 444,052 : change in gbp rate 2% 2021: 2% , group 2022 increase: 1,197,937, group 2022 decrease: 1,197,937 , group 2021 increase: 1,368, group 2021 decrease: 1,368 table end.
sensitivity analysis: impact of interest rate and exchange rate changes table: impact of interest rate and exchange rate changes on profit before tax year: 2022, increase in rate: 118,423, decrease in rate: 118,423 year: 2021, increase in rate: 445,245, decrease in rate: 445,245 table end.
this is mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on receivables and payables within the group at the reporting date.
the group's sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current year, mainly due to additional loans and borrowing denominated in united states dollar.
management's opinion is that the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk, as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
the group's exposure to this risk has been reduced since the group's long-term debt obligations are fixed interest rates.
equity price risk the group's listed equity investments are susceptible to market price risk from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities.
the group manages this risk through diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments.
reports on the equity portfolio are submitted to senior management regularly, and the board of directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions.
at the reporting date, the exposure to equity investments at fair value listed on the nigeria exchange group ngx was n5,278,575,000 31 december 2021: n5,411,024,000 . changes in fair values of the equity investments held are strongly positively correlated with changes in the ngx market index.
the group has determined that a 5% increase/decrease on the nse market index could impact income and equity attributable to the group by approximately n119,714,000 31 december 2021: n287,642,000 increase/decrease.
market risk market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, and other price risk such as equity price risk and commodity risk . financial instruments affected by market risk include deposits, loans, and borrowings.
7.1 expected credit loss measurement - other financial assets the company applied the general approach in computing expected credit losses ecl for intercompany receivables.
the company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses ecls for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss.
ecls are based on the difference between contractual cash flows due and all cash flows the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.
ecls are recognized in two stages.
for credit exposures without a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ecls are provided for credit losses from default events possible within the next 12 months a 12-month ecl . for credit exposures with a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default a lifetime ecl . the ecl is determined by projecting the probability of default pd , loss given default lgd , and exposure at default ead for each future month and for each individual exposure.
these three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of survival i.e., the exposure has not prepaid or defaulted in an earlier month . this effectively calculates an ecl for each future month, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed.
the discount rate used in the ecl calculation is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof.
the 12-month and lifetime pds are derived by mapping the internal rating grade of the obligors to the pd term structure of an external rating agency for all asset classes.
the 12-month and lifetime eads are determined based on the expected payment profile, which varies by product type.
the assumptions underlying the ecl calculation such as the maturity profile of the pds are monitored and reviewed regularly.
there have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or significant assumptions during the reporting period.
significant changes in the balances of other financial assets, including information about their impairment allowance, are disclosed separately.
the company considers a finance asset in default when contractual payments are 30 days past due.
however, in certain cases, the company may also consider a finance asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the company is unlikely to receive outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the company.
a finance asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
7.1a analysis of inputs to the ecl model under multiple economic scenarios an overview of the approach to estimating ecls is set out in note 3 significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.
to ensure completeness and accuracy, the group obtains the data used from third party sources central bank of nigeria, standards and poor's etc. and a team of experts within its credit risk department verifies the accuracy of inputs to the group's ecl models including determining the weights attributable to the multiple scenarios.
the following tables set out the key drivers of expected loss and the assumptions used for the group's base case estimate, ecls based on the base case, plus the effect of the use of multiple economic scenarios as at 31 december 2022 and 31 december 2021. the tables show the values of the key forward-looking economic variables/assumptions used in each of the economic scenarios for the ecl calculations.
the figures for “subsequent years” represent a long-term average and so are the same for each scenario.

excessive risk concentration the group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.
the group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders.
concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the group's performance to developments affecting a particular industry.
in order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the group's policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the maintenance of a diversified portfolio.
identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.

there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during 31 december 2022. there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during 2022. there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 during 2021. fair value measurement hierarchy for liabilities as at 31 december 2022: table: fair value measurement of company assets 31 december 2021 asset measured at fair value: listed equity investments note 25 , date of valuation: 31-dec-21, total n'000 : 3,887,961, quoted prices in active markets level 1 n'000 : 3,887,961, significant observable inputs level 2 n'000 : -, significant unobservable inputs level 3 n'000 : - table end.
fair value hierarchy the table above analyses assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
the different levels are defined as follows: level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the group can access at measurement date.
level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly i.e., as prices or indirectly i.e., derived from prices . this category includes instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
all level 2 valuation were derived using either the net present value and discounted cash flow models or comparison with similar instruments for which market observable prices exist.
level 3: inputs that are unobservable.
this category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation.
this category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 or between level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
valuation processes applied by the group the following fair valuation methods and assumptions were used: cash & cash equivalents: represents cash held in various bank accounts at the end of the year.
the fair value of this amount is the carrying amount.
trade and other receivables: represents amounts due from third parties and other related parties which usually have a short recycle period and as such the fair values of these balances approximate their carrying amount.
investment property: represents landed assets in portharcourt owned 100% by the group and is revalued annually by expert estate valuers using level 2 inputs.
the carrying amount is the fair value of the assets.

the comparison method of valuation was used to arrive at the fair value of the land.
this method involved analysis of similar properties that have recently been transacted upon in the open market within the locality and adjusting appropriately in arriving at the value.
significant increases decreases in estimated rental value and rent growth per annum in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value of the properties.
generally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated rental value is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the rent growth per annum and average land value per square meter.

in assessing goodwill for impairment at 31 december 2022, the group compared the recoverable amount of the net assets of the cgu to its respective carrying amounts.
based on the results of the impairment evaluation described below, the recorded goodwill was not impaired as the recoverable amount of the subsidiary exceeded the carrying value.
transcorp power limited cgu the recoverable amount of transcorp power limited cgu, n159,358,900,000 as at 31 december 2022, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period.
the projected cash flows have been updated to reflect the increased demand for products and services.
the pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 19.5% 2021: 15.5% and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 5.5% growth rate 2021: 3.5% that is the same as the long-term average growth rate for the power industry.

the following factors were considered in valuing the assets of the subsidiary: the open market method of valuation was used to arrive at the fair value of the land.
this method involved assessing the property physically, and by adopting the cost of construction used in capitalization to arrive at depreciated value after adjusting for depreciation.
also, a market research was analysed by comparing similar properties that have recently been transacted in the open market within the locality and adjusting appropriately in arriving at the value.
the land and building was fair valued in the open market using the depreciated replacement cost method of valuation, this method seeks to equate the market value of a property to the value of the site plus the current cost of erecting the building s and other infrastructural facilities on it, including professional fees and finance costs less allowance for passage of time.
significant increases decreases in estimated rental value and rent growth per annum in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value of the properties.
generally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated rental value is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the rent growth per annum and average land value per square meter.
the recoverable amount n76,282,996,000 2021:n74,787,894,000 exceeded the carrying amount n63,991,588,000 2021:n63,557,940,425 . based on the results of the impairment evaluation described above, the recorded goodwill was not impaired as the recoverable amount of the subsidiary exceeded the carrying value.

29.5 impairment of trade receivables an impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses.
the provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns i.e., by geographical region, product type and customer type . the calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
generally, trade receivables are written-off if past due for more than one year and are not subject to enforcement activity.
the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in note 7. the group does not hold collateral as security.
the letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance are considered integral part of trade receivables and considered in the calculation of impairment.
the group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets.

39. defined benefit plan - other employee benefit transcorp hotels plc provides a long-service award benefit to employees who are in active employment for a determined length of service.
the benefit is defined for different lengths of service in 8 bands of 5 years from 5 to 40 years with benefits escalating with the length of service.
the plan is funded from the company's operations for each year that there are qualifying staff members.
the benefit typically exposes the company to actuarial risks such as: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and attrition risk.
the risk relating to benefits to be paid to the qualifying staff members is borne by the company and factored into the computation of the defined benefit obligation.
the most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit liability were carried out at 31 december 2022 by mr. femi odutola odulana frc/2013/nas00000001320, fellow of the conference of consulting actuaries fca of giant consultants limited.
the present value of the defined benefit liability, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
key assumptions used: financial assumptions discount rate in line with ias 19, future benefits cash flow should be projected for each employee and discounted to their net present value as at the current balance sheet date, using an interest assumption called the discount rate under ias 19 . ias 19 requires an entity to determine the rate to be used for discounting long-term employees' benefits with reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
however, when there is no deep market in corporate bonds, an entity is required to use market yields on government bonds instead.
there is no deep market in corporate bonds in nigeria and we have determined the rate used for the current valuation by reference to the yield available on nigerian federal government bonds.
as at 31st december 2022, yields per annum on long-term government bond ranges between 13.35% and 14.50%. for the purpose of the current valuation, considering the plan's liability duration, we have adopted a discount rate of 13.0% p.a for the financial year 2022. benefit escalation rate the naira benefit escalation rate used for the actuarial valuation is 7.5% based on the historical escalation rate from the past three service contract amendments.
the dollar benefit escalation rate is based on official exchange rate projections of n100 increase every five years.
for instance, 2023 - 2027 has an assumed official $/ngn exchange rate of 500, 2028 - 2032 is 600. the source of this data is the central bank of nigeria's published projections.
demographic assumptions mortality in service the rates of mortality assumed for employees are the rates published in the a67/70 ultimate tables, published jointly by the institute and faculty of actuaries in the uk.
table: mortality rates sample age: 25, number of deaths in a year out of 10,000 lives: 7 sample age: 30, number of deaths in a year out of 10,000 lives: 7 sample age: 35, number of deaths in a year out of 10,000 lives: 9 sample age: 40, number of deaths in a year out of 10,000 lives: 14 sample age: 45, number of deaths in a year out of 10,000 lives: 26 table end.
withdrawal from service we have assumed a withdrawal rate for the current valuation at a rate starting from 5% for all ages up to age 30 years and decreasing to 1% at age 50 years then nil thereafter.
