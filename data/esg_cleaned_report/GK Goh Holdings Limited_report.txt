since becoming a publicly-listed company in june 2021, the company has made significant strides in running a more sustainable, responsible business.
managing through headwinds in 2022, issues relating to food insecurity were all the more highlighted on the macroeconomic level, where global food prices reached record peaks for key commodities such as wheat and palm oil.
the united nations' food and agriculture organization reported that key factors in the year's global market instability included climate variability and political circumstances.

executive messages yearly, the effects of climate change increase in intensity, disrupting livelihoods, production, and ecology.
countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change, some of which are major producers of key agricultural commodities, are experiencing the domino effect that extreme weather conditions have on business.
furthermore, sociopolitical factors, including export restrictions and geopolitical tension catalyzed by the russia-ukraine war, hinder the flow of goods and subsequently, the availability of imported resources.
as a food and beverage business, monde nissin witnessed firsthand how these socio-environmental factors can create significant impacts on the stability of the industry.
at the same time, monde nissin's corporate aspiration reminds us that we must also create our own solutions where we can.
the challenges of the year have only sharpened our resolve to achieve sustainable food solutions.
with our commitment to providing our consumers with accessible food, one of the concerns for monde nissin in 2022 was how we could continue to keep our products affordable amid inflationary pressures.
we did so while staying pragmatic in our fiscal management, balancing the stability of our business and ensuring we could remain resilient while sustaining the affordability of our products.
we were mindful of our price increases considering the impact it has on our consumers.
ensuring food accessibility also meant pursuing our strategies for growth and expanding the reach of our products.
on the local level, we continued to grow our community distribution network cdn composed of independent brand experts —individuals from our local communities that distribute monde nissin products, gaining a new source of livelihood.
more than delivering affordable food to our consumers, monde nissin continues to innovate our products to build a portfolio of healthier options.
this is hand-in-hand with our sustainability strategy as we implemented fortification and sodium reduction initiatives while seeking out more ways to improve the nutritional profile of our products.
consumer satisfaction and safety continue to be of utmost concern to us in 2022. monde nissin's stakeholders are assured of the quality of our food products, which undergo a number of quality and food safety management measures and are all registered pursuant to, and are compliant with the local regulations of the markets we operate in.

our meat alternative business meat alternative business , quorn foods, grew its market share to 32.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022, supported by the food service segment where its products were able to reach more schools, quick service restaurants, and hospitals in the uk.

chief sustainability officer's message dear stakeholders, sustainability has always been a part of our operations at monde nissin.
through our 2022 sr, we declared not only our economic, environmental, social, and governance eesg impacts but also our intention to make genuine strides toward sustainability.
it all starts with our corporate aspiration that outlines what monde nissin has set out to achieve – sustainable solutions for food security.
on the global scale, hunger continues to be a challenge.
the united nations un reported that, since 2019, the prevalence of undernourishment rose, and hundreds of millions suffer hunger around the world.
we at monde nissin believe that the solution to world hunger is sustainable food.
according to the un committee on world food security, being "food secure" means that one has "physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets one's dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life." in the context of the food industry, becoming a business that contributes to sustainable development means becoming able to satisfy appetites and fill needs sustainably – making them in a manner that is socially beneficial, economically viable, and environmentally sound.

alternatives such as soy and tofu are made available and prepared by the canteen staff.
this initiative is in line with monde nissin's belief that by reducing the consumption of meat, one can both decrease one's carbon footprint and improve nutrition.
single-use plastic ban in addition to meatless mondays, the plant implemented a single-use plastic ban.
plastic bags are prohibited in the workplace, encouraging staff to bring their own eco-bags or rent reusable bags at the entrance.
this has resulted in several employee behaviors that lessen plastic use, including reduced fast food delivery orders and increased use of water flasks and tumblers.
coastal clean-up and mangrove-planting program the employees' sustainable practices include a coastal clean-up and mangrove-planting program, which provided participants with first-hand experience of the effects of plastic trash on water bodies and a greater appreciation for projects of this kind.
christmas bazaar during the christmas season, a bazaar was organized where staff members sold homemade goods or secondhand items with zero plastic packaging.
many workers used paper bags.
exhibitors donated a minimum of 5% of their daily gross sales to cavanis sister's convent, an organization that provides free education to poor children and youth.
overall impact these initiatives promote a sustainability mindset within the monde nissin workforce, encouraging everyone to be more conscious of their impact on the planet and society.
where we are now in 2022, monde nissin continued to find ways to improve its internal systems to better support the monitoring and execution of sustainability-related activities.
this includes monitoring associated risks and opportunities and promoting a company-wide sustainability mindset.
monde nissin's north star targets are the company's way of operationalizing its sustainability goals, which it believes it can only achieve through a sustainability-committed leadership and a concerted effort across all levels of the business.
to promote a unified approach to sustainability that places value in the collaborative contributions of its employees, monde nissin prioritizes building capabilities and a sustainability culture.

procurement practices monde nissin local sourcing is a practice that minimizes shipping and storage and increases local revenue among suppliers in the area.
with this in mind, monde nissin actively searches for local suppliers to manage supply chain disruption-related risks and to promote local economic development.
less shipping distance also results in less logistical efforts and inventory.
as part of its purchasing policy, monde nissin tries to limit the importation of raw materials only to those not readily available in the philippines or when there are concerns relating to the quality, supply, or price of local raw materials.
monde nissin's imported materials consume more fuel due to distance and thus, contribute to carbon emissions.
specific to its production is the procurement of palm oil.
to address environmental and social concerns related to this area, the company is exploring further assessments on sustainability criteria.
the company is also aware that excessive procurement may result in increased waste.
monde nissin reuses packaging materials such as totes, plastic corrugated boards, and crates.
however, it currently does not have an available alternative for non-recyclable laminates, which it aims to resolve to better align with its eco-efficiency goals.
to better manage environmental, social, and governance risks within the supply chain, such as weather disturbances and supply chain disruptions, monde nissin constantly reviews its supply chain resiliency.
it has practices in place to mitigate the risk of volatile prices caused by supply chain disruptions.
a specific procurement policy is currently undergoing review within the company alongside a review of alternative materials sourcing.
this is a continuous improvement process being conducted by the npd department.

. monde nissin's corporate aspiration—to improve the well-being of people and the planet and create sustainable solutions for food security—requires a company-wide effort.
the company focuses on empowering its people to find ways to make progress toward its north star targets.
the company's holistic and uniform approach to improving eco-efficiency involves: enabling all employees at manufacturing sites to understand the business linkage with sustainability.
understanding major key losses and sources of losses to eliminate to achieve goals.
understanding capabilities and culture needed to achieve goals and commitments.
leveraging and linking standardized work systems, tailoring them to achieve goals per site.
providing a visual review process of key losses and identifying actions to eliminate them.
monde nissin uses two key tools to monitor and improve its environmental footprint: loss analysis: identifying and understanding 100% of losses within the organization.
loss map: generating a map of losses pertaining to the organization's various environmental impacts.
in 2022, monde nissin's product supply teams monitored the environmental impacts of the company's manufacturing plants, collecting baseline data in 2021. the teams then aligned their eco-efficiency targets with monde nissin's corporate roadmap.
the following pillars were established: electricity: through renewed monitoring and mapping of electricity consumption, monde nissin identified areas to control utilities use e.grams., uniform settings for electrical appliances across all plants . water: benchmarking against industry best practices in water management allowed monde nissin to adjust processes for water conversion from operations, enabling reuse and application to other plant-wide activities.
steam: a continuous learning mindset enabled monde nissin to innovate systems for more efficient boiler use e.grams., optimizing start-ups and shutdowns, harvesting rainwater, and automating processes . energy by improving its processes through the eco-efficiency thrust, monde nissin minimizes its negative environmental impacts and optimizes its operations.
this approach enables its employees to identify the gaps and implement the necessary action programs to increase energy efficiency.
an energy conservation enercon team was set up and meets on a weekly basis to eliminate losses on electricity, steam, and water.
the same enercon team allows monde nissin to benchmark results, systems, and processes across all sites, accelerating its progress on sustainability.
in july 2022, the following plant site locations shifted to renewable energy: laguna, batangas, and pampanga.
the cebu plant site switched to renewable energy last december 2022. the ongoing switch is a milestone in monde nissin's move toward opting for green energy.
monde nissin has also started to generate ideas and implement process optimizations and rate increases, enabling a 10% to 30% reduction in its utilities consumption.
this is applicable to monde nissin's noodles and bakery manufacturing lines.
