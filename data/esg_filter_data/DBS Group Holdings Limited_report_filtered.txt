coverage this report covers the environmental, social, and governance esg principles, initiatives and performance of our operations across our core markets.
feedback we welcome feedback on this report and any aspect of our sustainability performance.
please address all feedback to dbs group sustainability at sustainability@dbs.com.
the war between russia and ukraine raged on, additional armed conflicts broke out, most notably between israel and hamas, and tensions between the superpowers remained high.
on the climate front, we witnessed an unprecedented number of new records this past year.
ocean temperatures were the hottest ever measured.
all of this has been exacerbated by the start of el ni√±o, a natural climate shift that tends to raise global temperatures.
but the science is clear, the trajectory of global warming can only be changed if we reduce historically high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at speed and scale.
tragically, the impacts from climate change on the economy and society are becoming ever more evident.
studies have shown that insured and uninsured economic losses resulting from extreme climate-related weather conditions in 2023 were significantly higher than recent averages.
the number of people directly impacted by these calamities reached new highs, with the poor disproportionately affected, worsening social inequalities.
encouragingly, governments and regulators around the world have implemented an increasing number of meaningful policies that support the transition to net zero, which is being complemented by significant efforts of the private sector to transform global industries and supply chains.
globally, investments in clean energy overtook spending on fossil fuel at a ratio of 1.7:1, according to the international energy agency.
additionally, 118 countries pledged at the cop28 climate summit to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030. the electrification of transport has greatly accelerated across markets, and battery production has been scaling up.
nearer to home, asean ramped up its efforts to decarbonise and aims to create green corridors.
for example, in 2023 it installed over half of the world's total renewable power generation capacity, grew to become the world's largest electric vehicle market and exporter, and planted more trees than any other country in the world.
in our responsible banking pillar, we materially expanded our client engagement with large corporate customers on climate to deliver on the bold commitments we made in 2022 when we published 'our path to net zero supporting asia's transition to a low carbon economy'.
asia has around 5,000 operational coal power plants.
this endeavor is very complex, especially given the socio-economic context in asia and the imperative to accomplish this in a just manner.
to this end, we have supported and collaborated in initiatives with research and advocacy efforts to foster an ecosystem approach.
in addition to our focus on large corporates, we doubled down on our efforts to help smes in their sustainability efforts.
last year, we established several strategic partnerships with industry leaders to provide more comprehensive solutions to smes.
in hong kong, we partnered clp power to support smes' low-carbon transition.
additionally, we signed partnerships with a number of solutions providers such as keppel corp, schneider electric and reset carbon, among others.
furthermore, we engaged over 1,000 smes through various sustainability training courses and programmes to develop their capability and capacity in the field.
in our consumer banking group, we continued our efforts to provide customers with financial planning and an array of investment and financing solutions aimed at helping them to live more sustainably.
to date, more than singapore dollar 21 million has been invested through invest better in green funds and etfs, and over singapore dollar 2 million donated through give better for environmental and social causes.
furthermore, we developed a personal finance guidance, the dbs financial planning portal, to achieve holistic financial wellness across the key life stages.
in our responsible business practices pillar, we established the employee experience council to drive four key employee journeys, namely employee well-being, workload, assimilation of new hires and rewards & recognition.
we also launched our flagship women leadership programme which is specifically designed to build, support, and sustain a robust community of senior women leaders and strengthen our pipeline for senior leadership in the bank.
furthermore, we implemented a cloud-based data management platform to improve the end-to-end environmental data management.
this will enable us to further sharpen our strategy focused on reducing the environmental footprint of our own operations.
additionally, we materially expanded our sustainability learning campus to deepen knowledge of and empower employees to support our agenda and strategic initiatives.
as one example, we trained over 1,800 relationship managers and credit risk managers to empower them with necessary climate-related knowledge.
finally, in our impact beyond banking pillar, we committed up to singapore dollar 1 billion over the next 10 years to improve lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged, and foster a more inclusive society.
in addition, our workforce committed to over 1.5 million volunteer hours of training per employee over the next decade to give back to society.
in 2023, the dbs foundation awarded singapore dollar 3.7 million in grant funding to 24 smes and social enterprises across the region through its business for impact chapter.
the dbs foundation also committed another singapore dollar 5.6 million to support 11 new programmes to build future-ready skills and food security among vulnerable segments through its community impact chapter.
recognising our role in society and pursuing our vision last year, dbs marked our 55th anniversary.
with roots as the development bank of singapore, established with the express intent to help singapore's industrialisation, the idea of being sustainable, being relevant to society, doing real things for real people, and therefore having a purpose, has been deeply rooted in our dna.
i am grateful for the hard work and perseverance of dbs employees, as well as our clients and partners, on this journey.
i am confident that our collective efforts and dedication will allow us to accelerate action at scale and speed, to support a future in asia which is greener, and just.
the summary of performance against our climate targets tracks the annual variance against the science-informed decarbonisation pathways we have chosen to guide us towards our interim 2030 targets and net zero 2050 targets for each of our priority sectors.
we have observed good progress in five out of seven sectors, and they track well against the relevant science-informed decarbonisation pathways.
addressing these will often need broader ecosystem partnerships across the public and private sectors.
we remain committed to working with our clients and fostering partnerships to enable an economy-wide transition to net zero that is orderly and just.

in 2023, the bsc met quarterly and discussed several topics related to sustainability, including but not limited to: global themes relevant to dbs and our sustainability strategy.
climate risk considerations including physical and transition risks, and enhancements to our esg risk assessments.
dbs' approach to sustainability client engagement on transition planning, as well as green and sustainable financing solutions.
dbs' approach to disclosures, including adherence to new sustainability- and climate-related reporting standards and frameworks.
the board receives regular updates on key sustainability matters arising from these quarterly bsc meetings.
at dbs, we take an integrated approach to governance of sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities.
the audit committee ac and the board risk management committee brmc also have oversight responsibilities for sustainability-related activities.
in 2023, the ac received regular updates on sustainability-related disclosure requirements, while the brmc discussed and reviewed climate considerations as part of the wider risk management processes.
given the increasing regulatory and legal relevance of esg matters, internal audit and legal & compliance attend gsc meetings as observers.
the gsc, through the chief sustainability office, coordinates and collaborates sustainability efforts with the five local sustainability councils lscs established in our core markets outside of singapore china, hong kong, taiwan, india, and indonesia . in addition to the gsc, the lscs serve as executive forums for discussions and operational decision-making on sustainability matters.
in 2023, we established a cross-functional steering committee called project net zero, which drives the operationalisation of our climate agenda across our net zero commitment, risk management, and reporting.
embedding sustainability into performance management and remuneration we use a balanced scorecard approach to measure how successful we are in serving our key stakeholders and executing our long-term strategy.
sustainability and climate-related targets are incorporated into our group scorecard and cascaded across the relevant units' scorecards, which are used to evaluate performance.
as a result, we have refined our approach including: establishing an environmental and social incident management guide to ensure timely and appropriate response to any reports of environmental and social incidents.
uplifting our sustainable sourcing principles ssp to further promote the principles of restorative procurement amongst our suppliers.
the board receives regular briefings on sustainability matters, including from external sustainability experts.
to further embed sustainability into every aspect of our business and build the capacity of our people, in 2023 we identified three key sustainability learning priorities and enhanced the dbs sustainability learning campus, considering different target audiences within the bank.
for senior leaders to further our senior management understanding of the business imperatives arising from sustainability risks and opportunities, and support the integration of esg risks and opportunities into strategic decision-making, we collaborated with cambridge university's institute for sustainability leadership to conduct a full-day senior leadership workshop.
the interactive workshop included cases on sustainability best practices and challenging dilemmas, with an emphasis on solving real-world problems.

customers we interact with customers to better understand their requirements so that we can provide the right financial solutions for them.
we reinforced our respectful, easy to deal with, dependable red service standards by developing an extensive empathy training programme to enhance our ability to solve the root causes of negative experiences.
we continue to adopt a customer-obsessed culture and improve banking journeys.
we approved over 4,400 unsecured loans totalling singapore dollar 665 million to micro and small businesses and continued to harness our data capabilities to proactively reach out to our sme customers to address their working capital requirements.
we intensified our client engagement on their net zero and transition strategies to empower our clients on their sustainability planning and decarbonisation journeys.
for example, we partnered with skillsfuture singapore, a singapore government agency, to upskill smes and help strengthen their sustainability skills through the dbs sme skills booster programme.

employees were also engaged regularly through quarterly pulse surveys to identify areas of concerns and/or pain points.
dbs has continually improved our employee experience in response to employee feedback, resulting in more impactful outcomes such as improved employee advocacy, retention and motivation.
in 2023, we established the employee experience council to prioritise four focus areas: employee well-being, workload, assimilation of new hires, and rewards & recognition.
read more about "enhancing employee engagement and culture" on page 46. society we engage the community to better understand the role we can play to address societal needs and gaps.
we awarded singapore dollar 3.7 million in grant funding to 24 awardees across the region through the 2023 dbs foundation business for impact grant award.
this programme is to recognise, reward and support both smes and ses to scale their business model and deepen their social and/or environmental impact.
we continued to scale our volunteerism footprint by encouraging employees to embrace new creative ways of volunteering, incorporating a hybrid of in-person and virtual approaches.
in transcending limitations and geographical constraints, we successfully redefined the concept of volunteering.
in august 2023, we announced a commitment of up to singapore dollar 1 billion over the next 10 years to improve lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged, and foster a more inclusive society.
additionally, we seek to be a strong representative voice for asia and asian financial services at local and global industry forums.
following the technology incidents in 2023, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap to further enhance our resilience and enhance stakeholder's confidence and trust.
to reinforce governance and oversight of technology risk, we established the board technology risk committee.
we partnered regulators, industry peers, and enforcement agencies to address the risk of mobile malware and respond to the evolving online scams targeting our banking customers.
we collaborated with regulators and industry peers to plan and execute an industry-wide cyber security exercise to test and improve the industry readiness to respond to a wide scale cyber security affecting the banking ecosystem.
they inform our approach to governance, risk management, strategy and reporting.
our materiality assessment process we review our material esg factors annually following a four-step process: 1. identify the sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities relevant for dbs across our value chain by: incorporating feedback from stakeholder engagements, with a focus on gathering investor views on materiality research into industry developments and benchmarking against global peers referencing relevant sector standards and frameworks, such as those from gri and sasb read more about our stakeholder engagement on page 10. 2. assess & prioritise the identified esg factors based on a "double materiality" approach, which considers: impact materiality: significance of our outward impacts on the economy, environment, and people financial materiality: significance of the esg factor for our ability to drive long-term value creation 3. validate the prioritised list of material esg factors included discussion with key business and support units, before being reviewed by: group sustainability council group chief executive officer board sustainability committee 4. integrate the resulting material esg factors into governance structures, risk management processes, strategy development and our reporting to stakeholders.
we also created a new topic on the overall resilience of technology at dbs, which includes the previous topic of cyber security.
climate change technology resilience incl.
cyber security developing our people data governance financial crime prevention financial inclusion esg fundamentals these form the foundation of sustainability at dbs and underpin our ability to drive long-term value creation and ensure we operate as a responsible and sustainable business.
diversity, equity and inclusion employee volunteerism human rights employee engagement and culture fair dealing responsible tax operational environmental footprint sustainable procurement supporting social enterprises and the community human rights at dbs, we believe that every individual has human rights as enshrined in the united nations‚Äô universal declaration on human rights.
we also recognise that today the world faces considerable social and human rights challenges that require collaboration between all members of society to overcome.
in our capacity as a leading financial institution in asia, we are committed to respecting human rights across all aspects of our business.
our approach has been designed to acknowledge the economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious context in asia where we operate.
governance of human rights in 2022, we established a human rights policy, which was approved by our board sustainability committee bsc and formalised our commitment to respect human rights.
our chief sustainability officer has oversight of our policy and approach to respect human rights, and works closely with other members of our management team to embed human rights due diligence across our business.
our human rights policy forms part of a set of policies and frameworks that work to embed human rights due diligence and enable remediation of any adverse human rights impacts across our business.
the human rights policy sets out our overarching approach to human rights, and includes our commitment to the united nations guiding principles on businesses and human rights.
read more about our human rights policy . the group responsible financing standard documents our approach to responsible financing, covering esg issues, which expressly includes human rights.
it outlines esg-related prohibited transactions, which includes finance activities associated with forced labour, child labour, and violation of the rights of local communities.
it is supplemented by nine sector guides which provide more sector-specific guidance in sectors with elevated human rights risks.
our sector guides provide our relationship managers and credit risk managers a structured approach to assessing human rights risks.
all new suppliers are asked to agree to these principles upon contracting with us.
read more about our approach in our sustainable procurement chapter on page 66. our approach to embedding human rights due diligence 1. identifying salient 1 human rights issues in 2023, we conducted a review to update our understanding of the most significant human rights risks across our business activities and relationships.

3 community rights include cultural, land and resource related rights.
2. assessing and addressing human rights impacts as a bank, we recognize that we can contribute to human rights across different areas of our business.
we aim to respect human rights in our roles: as a lender and services provider: for more details on our approach, see sections on responsible financing, data governance, and fair dealing.
as an employer in our workplace: for more details on our approach, see sections driving diversity, equity and inclusion as well as enhancing employee engagement and culture.
3. grievance mechanisms we are committed to taking appropriate measures to address actual and potential human rights impacts identified by our due diligence process.
in each market where we operate, dbs maintains multiple channels of communication for our stakeholders, including customers, employees, and suppliers, to share their concerns with us.
in addition to these communication channels, dbs speak up is our whistleblowing program, run by an independent third party.
the process includes: the establishment of a cross-departmental working group to manage the incident escalation, management, and resolution procedures a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and incorporate changes into existing processes to improve our approach record keeping to preserve relevant information 5. tracking the effectiveness of our human rights due diligence processes dbs is committed to continuously improving our approach to respecting human rights.
a post-incident review is conducted following the resolution of a human rights incident to identify lessons learned and incorporate changes into existing processes to improve our approach.
an esg dashboard that includes any material human rights incidents is reported to the bsc on a quarterly basis.
in 2023, we also held two sessions with the bsc on esg risks, including human rights risks arising from grievances and litigation examples related to the banking industry.
dbs is committed to continuously improving our approach to respecting human rights.
6. reporting and communication we are committed to reporting on internal policy developments and the work we do in relation to human rights, including the evaluation of human rights risks, and our response to human rights impacts.
we believe that greater transparency builds trust, and as we refine our approach to human rights in the coming years, we will report on our progress as well as the challenges and trade-offs we face.
our ambition in our human rights journey is to understand the impact that dbs has through our business.
we will raise awareness through enhanced disclosures and continual and robust engagement with our stakeholders: our employees, clients, and business partners.
from ambition to action dbs group holdings ltd sustainability report 2023 14 pillar 1: responsible banking responsible financing sustainable living financial inclusion a compass image symbolizing the direction of responsible banking.
responsible financing supporting asia's transition to a low-carbon economy as a bank, the largest impact we create is through our financing activities.
it is critical that we continually strengthen our capabilities to support a more sustainable, just and prosperous society.
a key priority is accelerating climate action, given its urgency and how it is linked to other environmental and socio-economic challenges.
tackling climate change is a global imperative.
we are already witnessing the impacts of a changing climate, and unless urgent action is taken to decarbonise our economies, these impacts will worsen.
at dbs, we have made significant progress in translating our climate ambition into action.
since becoming a signatory of the net zero banking alliance nzba in october 2021, we announced our net zero commitments and established our very first set of science-informed decarbonisation targets for our scope 3 financed emissions in 2022. our 2030 and 2050 climate targets guide and direct our lending and financing efforts to support the economy-wide transformation.
our climate strategy to operationalise our climate strategy and commitment to net zero, we have established a dedicated steering committee which provides oversight across policies, processes and platforms.
forging new partnerships to provide supply chain and related financing.

ensuring robust governance processes.
reskilling and empowering our people.
‚Äúsustainability continues to be high on national and corporate agendas, as a growing urgency for climate action raises the stakes for a just energy transition.
asia will be where the climate battle is won or lost.
we embed our ambition and commitment to net zero in our client engagement, while recognizing limitations and challenges different sectors face in their business operations.
this allows us to group clients into archetypes based on their level of maturity in their sustainability journey, and offer financing solutions and advice tailored to their needs.
how we help our clients: financing solutions to support their pipeline of investment measures, including the establishment of sustainable finance frameworks; advisory on mitigation of their emissions across their value chain; and sharing insights on key industry esg considerations, including climate-related risks and opportunities for their sector.
we have engaged our most carbon-intensive clients on net-zero planning.
these conversations help us to understand where our clients are on their net-zero journey and how dbs could partner with them in their decarbonization efforts.
we identified and actively engaged at least the top 10 emitters from each of our priority sectors: oil & gas, power, shipping, aviation, steel, automotive, real estate almost 90% of the top emitting clients that we have engaged have a net-zero plan.
for example, in 2022, sustainable aviation fuel saf comprised only 0.1% of overall jet fuel used.
2. supply chain constraints such as labor shortages or scarcity of raw materials e.grams., the lack of scrap metals in asia for less carbon-intensive steel production . 3. the lack of government incentives to support the adoption of low-carbon solutions e.grams., electric vehicles and charging stations , which impede affordability, especially in emerging markets.
enabling our relationship management teams to effectively engage clients: our approach to steering portfolios towards net zero is driven by robust internal processes and digital tools: 1. regular cadence with sector teams to monitor performance: a central team of sustainable finance experts maintains active dialogue with sector coverage teams across all our core markets and where we have a sizable international presence.
this ensures esg considerations and clients' decarbonization plans are at the forefront of our relationship managers' malaysian ringgit minds.
3. actively manage portfolio with digital tools: since establishing our net-zero targets, we focused on developing tools to support our rms to understand our clients' position on climate change and forecast their future climate change performance using scenario analysis.
our climate analytics tool cat generates insights on the simulated emissions performance trends of a client over the short, medium, and long-term.
this facilitates more in-depth and forward-looking conversations to guide our clients in operationalizing their decarbonization plans more effectively.
we contribute our views on various industry or government-led working groups, technical committees, forums, and one-on-one meetings.
we seek to promote the development and adoption of policies, frameworks, and guidance that accelerate action on climate change both in the markets we operate in and globally.
below are some examples of our industry and policy engagements in 2023: supporting the transition monetary authority of singapore mas : dbs actively participated in several mas projects and working groups, such as on managed coal phase out.
we have committed to being a partner in the mas-convened project, the transition credits coalition traction . the project aims to explore the creation of credible, high-integrity transition credits to support the managed and early phase out of coal power plants.
the taskforce comprises of representatives from financial institutions, corporates, non-governmental organisations, and financial industry associations which aims to i develop a taxonomy; ii improve disclosures; iii foster green finance solutions; and iv enhance environmental risk management practices of financial institutions.
world business council for sustainable development wbcsd : dbs is a member of wbcsd and participates in several project groups including the working group on redefining value, which helps companies address the link between sustainability efforts and valuation.
business opportunities providing innovative financing solutions we provide practical and innovative financing solutions for our clients to implement their sustainability strategies.
to help accelerate clients' decarbonisation efforts, especially those in hard-to-abate sectors, it is critical that we provide financing for climate mitigation solutions.
in addition to financing green and renewable energy projects, enabling financing for the transition to lower carbon alternatives in hard-to-abate sectors is equally important to achieve a just and orderly transition.
case studies: case study 1: dbs structured the first sustainability-linked loan for global semiconductor company nexperia as the sole original mandated lead arranger, bookrunner and sustainability coordinator.
the united states dollar 800 million loan utilised environmental and social key performance indicators kpis relating to greenhouse gas emissions and gender diversity with a focus on including more women in management positions.
nexperia issued its first sustainability report in 2023 and announced its target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. the kpis used are a reaffirmation of their commitment.
case study 2: dbs provided a united states dollar 16 million idr 244 billion green trade finance facility to pt indomobil sukses internasional tbk indomobil , an integrated automotive business group.
to meet increasing demand for low-carbon vehicles, indomobil plans to utilise the facility to grow its fleet of ev assets.
the transaction aligns with the indonesian government's sustainability goals to expand the domestic ev ecosystem, as part of the nation's decarbonisation agenda.
through this relatively low-cost solution to generate remote and automated real-time readings to the energy supplier - it cuts down manpower and logistic costs, identify service issues quickly resulting in improved uptime and energy conservation as well as informing strategies to improve energy efficiency.
case study 4: dbs acted as one of the joint social loan coordinators to execute a united states dollar 750 million syndicated social loan for housing development finance corporation hdfc ltd, india's largest housing finance company.
proceeds of the facility are utilised for financing of affordable housing in accordance with hdfc's social financing framework.
ceo message in addition to the above sustainable financing solutions, we also facilitate the accelerated phase-out of high-emitting assets, such as the early and managed phase-out mpo of coal-fired power plants in asia, among others.
although accelerating their early retirement will be complex and costly given the socio-economic context in asia, it is key towards meeting the goals of the paris agreement and achieving a low-carbon future.
to this end, we are supportive of the global efforts related to the early and mpo of coal in asia, and have collaborated in initiatives with research and advocacy efforts to foster an ecosystem approach.
furthermore, we recognise that such financing for example, the early retirement of coal-fired power plants would impact our near-term financed emissions reduction progress.
however, we see this as a strategic move in supporting the longer-term climate positive outcome.
as we are concluding our advisory mandate for the indonesian investment authority ina and reaching financial close for the energy transition mechanism etm programme in indonesia, we will disclose the positions of our power portfolio's emissions with and without the additional emissions arising from the early retirement of coal power assets in asia.
case study 5: the early retirement of a coal-fired power plant in indonesia, the first under asian development bank's energy transition mechanism etm ‚Äì cirebon-1, a 660-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
the signing of a non-binding framework agreement between the asian development bank, pt perusahaan listrik negara, pt cirebon electric power and ina during the 28th conference of parties cop28 in december 2023 was a testament to dbs' advisory capability.
this partnership aligns with the indonesian government's sustainability goals to achieve significant emission reductions through a scalable model that can be applied to other integrated power players in indonesia and beyond.
financing infrastructure projects for climate adaptation climate adaptation measures are often assessed and embedded in infrastructure projects that we finance, including financings related to toll roads, sanitation, waste, and run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects, among others.
additionally, clients have started including climate adaptation plans in their construction designs.
selected clients that we have worked with are highlighted below.
some of the proceeds were allocated to coastal defence and nature-based solutions aimed at strengthening climate adaptation.
measures to mitigate the urban heat island "uhi" effect through urban planning and building design optimised for shade and wind flow, and integrating urban greenery to reduce heat absorption.
dbs advised and co-developed psa singapore's green finance framework, which was launched in june 2023. some of these green eligible projects include: investments in the port infrastructure to make it adaptive to climate risks.
. 2 a smart tariff is a type of energy tariff that varies depending on the time of day or the amount of energy used.
this means that consumers can save money by using energy at off-peak times, when demand is lower.
green singapore government securities sgs infrastructure bonds: we continue to play our part to advance singapore‚Äôs national agenda on sustainable development.
we were re-appointed last year as joint bookrunner and sole retail coordinator for the reopening of the 50-year green sgs infrastructure bonds by the government of singapore.
forging new strategic partnerships besides the need for financing, companies also need to build their sustainability capabilities and capacity.
based on engagement with our clients, we understand that many companies that are just starting out on their sustainability journey may lack specific skillsets in areas such as measuring and monitoring carbon emissions, certifications, or sustainability disclosures.
having identified the common pain points our clients face, we have begun to establish and grow our ecosystem partnerships to address the key challenges faced by our clients and broaden our product offerings to support them on their sustainability journeys.
with our expanding network of partners, we are able to provide advice on decarbonisation solutions relevant to our customers‚Äô needs across industry sectors, provide financing to fund those solutions, and offer business-matching opportunities.
some notable partnerships established in 2023 h&m group: dbs partnered with the apparel group to establish collaborative financing solutions to accelerate the necessary decarbonisation of fashion supply chains.
through the programme, suppliers get access to sustainable financing from dbs and technical support from sustainability consultant, guidehouse, to embark on factory upgrades to help them improve their energy efficiency.
unlike traditional banking solutions which seek to encourage such green activities indirectly, this programme provides direct funding with highly favourable terms to suppliers for specific greenhouse gas emission reduction activities, as approved by h&m group.
the first successful transaction was completed in 2023, with a manufacturer in india to fund capital expenditures to reduce their carbon emissions.
clp power: in late 2022, dbs hong kong partnered clp power to provide smes with opportunities to invest in energy efficiency upgrades.
these opportunities were closely tied to clp power‚Äôs energy-as-a-service business.
the successful partnership was further expanded in june 2023, where we announced the launch of a new "sme low-carbon rewards" programme.
this programme is tailored to further support hong kong smes in their transition to a low-carbon economy, while supporting the development of local renewable energy and promoting digital payment services adoption.
the partnership also enables more smes to tap into the energy saving services offered by clp to reduce operating expenses that would not be possible without.
building our climate and esg risk management capabilities and integrating climate risk considerations into our overall enterprise risk management processes continues to be a top priority.
it also allows us to engage customers on environmental and social topics while promoting responsible financing through agreed mitigating measures.
in july 2023, we strengthened our esg risk assessment for our borrowing customers through the introduction of an enhanced esg risk questionnaire erq . the erq is based on the association of banks in singapore abs environmental risk questionnaire, which has been adapted to include additional questions covering key esg topics relevant to assessing the risks and adaptability of our customers.
the erq facilitates our data collection for customers‚Äô climate risk disclosures and is used as a customer engagement tool to understand customers‚Äô transition plans and explore financing and facilitation opportunities to support their transition to lower carbon businesses.
responses obtained from the erq are combined with sector-level inputs from our climate stress testing exercise to provide an assessment of sector-level climate risk, individual borrower-level climate risk, and other non-climate-related esg risks.
defined by our internal control framework, our first-line business teams and risk functions have clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the new esg risk assessment process.
as one of our key enablers to continually deliver and operationalize our climate agenda, we prioritize reskilling and empowering our people on the subject matter.
for example, extensive training sessions are provided to rms and crms to enhance skillsets that will allow them to better assess the esg risks of our customers.
update to our approach to phase out thermal coal financing asia accounts for around half of global greenhouse gas emissions 3 . about a third of this arises from its approximately 5,000 operational coal-fired power plants 4 . furthermore, coal accounts for almost 60% of power generation in asia, with energy demand in this region expected to double by 2050, driven by strong population and economic growth 4 . if all of asia's existing coal-fired power plants alone were to run until the end of their operational lifespan, we will exhaust about two-thirds of the carbon budget we have left to keep global temperature rise below 1.5¬∞c as compared to pre-industrial levels.
additionally, even if the deployment of clean tech solutions and renewable energy at scale and speed are maximized, which we must, the world will not be able to accomplish the goals of the paris agreement, unless we drastically reduce the number of operational coal power plants in asia.
our approach is guided by the gfanz guidance paper on 'financing the managed phaseout of coal-fired power plants in asia pacific', which includes three main steps: step a: ensuring credibility of relevant energy transition and coal phaseout commitments and plans step b: optimizing 'meaningful' impact across climate impact, financial viability, and socioeconomic considerations step c: achieving transparency and accountability for coal phaseout plans in line with the gfanz net zero transition plan framework therefore, our updated thermal coal phase-out approach will consist of the following: we cease onboarding new customers who derive more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal.
from january 2026, we will stop financing existing customers who derive more than 50% of revenue from thermal coal, except for their non-thermal coal or renewable energy activities.
this will be conducted through engagements with customers to establish their transition strategies, and the incorporation of emissions reduction targets in all applicable sustainability-linked loan structures.
we will disclose our thermal coal exposure annually in our sustainability report.
since 2019, we have ceased the financing of any new thermal coal mining or thermal power assets and have progressively phased down our exposures to thermal coal year on year.

5 the equator principles "ep" is a voluntary environmental and social risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions, for determining, assessing, and managing environmental and social risk in project financing.
it is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making.
embedding human rights due diligence into our financing approach social considerations are a fundamental aspect of our overall esg risk assessment process.
among others, the following social-related issues are considered in our financing decisions: forced and child labor worker rights, including fair wages, reasonable working hours of training per employee, safe working conditions, as well as freedom of association and collective bargaining community rights, including cultural, land, and resource-related rights we conduct esg risk assessments as part of all new credit applications, annual credit reviews, or in the event there are negative esg news or reports regarding our customers.
in 2023, we further enhanced the erq, which already covered social risks, to specifically assess our customers' human rights issues, including forced labor, child labor, labor practices, and community rights.
we also enhanced a supporting document to provide rms and crms with more detailed guidance on assessing human rights risks.
where a project has the potential to cause adverse human rights impacts, an assessment of such impacts shall be conducted.
in addition to environmental issues, critical human rights issues and the tracking of any required remediation are embedded in our due diligence and post-transaction monitoring.
read more about our reporting on the equator principles on page 36, and more about our approach to human rights due diligence on page 13. establishing environmental and social incident management guide adverse environmental and social impacts that occur within our value chain pose a substantial risk to the bank and impact the credit profile of our customers and the bank's reputation.
with rising awareness of environmental and social issues amongst our stakeholders and strengthening legal frameworks, we anticipate a corresponding rise in queries, complaints, and legal action related to environmental and social issues in asia, as they have in other parts of the world.
in 2023, we developed an environmental and social e&s incident management guide.
an e&s incident is defined as an event with actual or potential adverse environmental or social impacts caused by dbs group's operations, products, or services.
stress testing and climate scenario analysis climate change has the potential to impact our customers' future creditworthiness, as well as the financial stability of the broader economy.
at dbs, we recognize the importance of climate scenario analysis as a vital tool to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as elucidate the potential implications of climate change for our strategy and business model over the short, medium, and long term.
one of our priorities under our climate strategy is to integrate climate considerations into our risk management processes to ensure the short, medium, and long-term resiliency of our business.
in 2023, we further strengthened our climate and esg risk management capabilities through the development of a centralized data repository for more effective and efficient data and analytics.
our approach to climate scenario analysis includes: transition risk analysis: is conducted using a suite of climate scenario analysis csa models.
the csa translates the effects of policy and regulation changes, technology development, and changes in consumer preferences, as defined by a set of standard climate scenarios, into impact to key financial drivers identified for each sector.
in 2023, we further refined our models to include the latest network for greening the financial system ngfs scenarios.
to date, we have conducted transition risk scenario analyses for our nine priority sectors, selected based on their significance within the ibg portfolio and carbon emissions contribution.
physical risks analysis: is conducted through forward-looking models that assess the physical effects of climate change on our clients' assets and operations over the short, medium, and long term, based on scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shared socioeconomic pathways ssps . in our analysis, we consider: acute risks resulting from increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, droughts, and floods.
in 2023, we enhanced geo-location data coverage for our portfolio and expanded our climate physical risk assessment to cover more hazards e.grams., tropical cyclones, flooding, among others . we also commenced a pilot study in the real estate sector to further refine our approach to assessing climate-related physical risk across our portfolios.
read more about our methodologies to climate scenario analysis modeling on page 105. footnotes: 5 equator principles summary of our climate scenario analysis in the real estate sector in 2023, we further expanded our pilot to assess the climate-related transition risks and physical risks in the real estate sector.
transition risk the sector comprises real estate operators, property developers and investment managers, and is characterized by its relatively low emissions intensity compared with other priority sectors during its operational phase.
it should be noted that emissions embodied in building materials could contribute considerably to climate change.
based on the ngfs net zero scenario, climate transition risk to the real estate sector was assessed to be immaterial.
given the generally low emission intensities in all scopes of emissions as reported by our customers at baseline compared to other priority sectors, the proportion of carbon costs is likely to be relatively low as compared to the total operating costs, resulting in minimal financial impacts arising from climate transition risk.
since 2018, we have rolled out mandatory responsible financing e-learning training to all rms and crms to ensure alignment with our esg policies and standards.
newly hired rms and crms are assigned this training during onboarding, while a refresher training is assigned to existing colleagues every two years.
amongst rms and crms assigned to this mandatory training in 2023, 87% had completed the training as of october 2023 7 . we also held a series of green and sustainable trade financing trainings for rms to learn how to identify relevant opportunities and provide advisory and financial solutions to better support our customers.
in parallel to establishing our net zero targets in 2022, we also developed an inaugural climate-activation training that was progressively rolled out in the first half of 2023 for over 1,800 rms and crms to empower them with the necessary climate-related knowledge to meaningfully engage customers in their decarbonisation and transition journeys.
notes: 6 shared socio-economic pathway ssps are climate change scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100 as defined by inter-governmental panel on climate change ipcc . 7 this refers to the number of employees assigned the responsible financing e-learning training within 2023 only.
please note that if employees are reassigned the training towards the end of the year, they are not required to complete it till early part of the following year.
metrics and targets net zero portfolio alignment to fulfill our commitment as a signatory to the nzba, we are committed to monitoring and reporting our progress against our sectoral targets annually.
the first set consists of seven scope 3 emissions reduction targets, while the second set is made up of two data coverage targets.
collectively, our commitment covers a total of nine priority sectors power, oil & gas o&g , automotive, aviation, shipping, steel, real estate, food & agribusiness f&a , and chemicals . altogether, these nine priority sectors are recognized as some of the most carbon-intensive sectors in the real economy and collectively account for a majority of global greenhouse gas emissions.
table 1 summarizes the coverage of our priority sectors for our scope 3 financed emissions, reference scenarios, and 2050 targets, while table 2 outlines our latest position for the reporting year 2023. the summary of our decarbonisation performance on the right tracks the annual variance against the science-informed decarbonisation pathways we have chosen to guide us towards our interim 2030 targets and net zero 2050 targets for each of our priority sectors figure 4 . we have observed good emissions reduction progress in five out of seven sectors, and they track well against the relevant science-informed decarbonisation pathways.
addressing these will often need broader ecosystem partnerships across the public and private sectors.
we remain committed to working with our clients and fostering partnerships to enable an economy-wide transition to net zero that is orderly and just.

16 in-scope sectors included in our financed emission calculations refer to the sub-sectors and types of financings that apply only to relevant value chains of the respective sectors due to the different nature of activities.
power sector emissions intensity chart showing emission intensity from 2020 to 2050, with data points for iea nze, baseline position, dbs portfolio 2022 position, and dbs portfolio 2023 position.
as vertically integrated power players are active throughout the entire electricity value chain, customers in this category typically generate higher emissions intensity compared to corporates that solely invest in power generation assets.
the marginal increase in our recalculated 2022 emission intensity to 229 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours from 227 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours originally stems from this expansion of in-scope customers.
after the aforementioned expansion of in-scope customers, the final 2023 emissions intensity result shows a marginal increase to 234 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours from 229 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours in 2022 . this increase is a result of expanding the in-scope clients to include critical power and utility players that contribute to energy security within the apac region.
under the original methodology, the 2023 emissions intensity result for the power sector would have shown a decrease to 226 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours from 227 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours originally in 2022 . although the emissions intensity for the power sector increased marginally from 2022, we expanded our client coverage and product expertise within the renewables space as further elaborated on how we are managing our renewable energy portfolio on the right . as a result, the overall performance for the power sector remains in a downward trajectory, with a decrease of approximately 10% since the baseline.
we are pleased to report that our 2023 financed emissions for the power sector remain significantly below the iea nze reference scenario of 378 kgco‚ÇÇ/megawatt-hours for the same year.
challenges and opportunities while we continue to grow our renewable energy portfolio and phase out thermal coal financing, dbs also recognizes the importance of energy security in the region.
several asean countries have announced ambitious targets to reach carbon neutrality.
however, they continue to face challenges in deploying the capital required to build up grid infrastructure and scale up a stable supply of renewable energy.
the transition for the power sector depends not only on financial institutions but also on governmental policies and support, as well as technological advancements to improve commercial viability.
changes in legislation and policies would be required, including increased regional cooperation, to i drive more resources towards quicker deployment of low-carbon technologies and ii attract more capital from foreign investors and financial institutions.
dbs is also collaborating with the indonesia investment authority ina on their energy transition mechanism for the early retirement of thermal coal plants.
next steps we have been engaging with clients to encourage the adoption of lower-carbon fuel mix for power generation and to explore areas that dbs can support them beyond financing.
by utilizing our in-house developed analytics tools, we will be able to monitor and simulate potential emissions trends based on different economic and environmental scenarios.
this will help us to better understand our clients' needs and advise them on the various available transition and financing solutions that are suitable for their consideration.
the power sector's financed emissions reduction is on track to meet our 2030 target and has been performing below the iea nze reference scenario.
we remain committed to supporting our clients in the power sector in their efforts to achieve net zero by 2040, which is crucial in decarbonising the other industry sectors to achieve net zero by 2050. managing our renewable energy portfolio our renewable energy financing increased from over singapore dollar 7 billion in 2022 to singapore dollar 10 billion in 2023. this growth was driven by new loans granted to our key clients across the markets we operate in.
examples of our renewable energy financing activities include a first-of-its-kind solar project financing in bangladesh for a chinese-led consortium and advising and arranging the financing for a singaporean energy client acquiring renewable energy assets in vietnam.
our power sector's overall positive performance can be attributed to two factors: i our efforts to systematically support our clients as they build or acquire more renewable energy assets and ii our focus on advising and supporting our clients in their transition journey as they pivot towards low-carbon technology and solutions.
as part of our ongoing efforts to drive decarbonisation in the real economy, we are collaborating with various governmental agencies and power industry players to facilitate a just transition in the mpo of coal-fired power plants.
oil & gas o&g chart depicting absolute financed emissions mtco‚ÇÇe from 2020 to 2050, showing a decrease from 38.6 mtco‚ÇÇe in 2020 to 26.2 mtco‚ÇÇe in 2023. data points are labeled for iea nze, baseline position 2022, and dbs portfolio positions for 2022 and 2023. 2023 performance the absolute financed emissions for our o&g sector decreased year-on-year and now stands at 26.2 mtco‚ÇÇe, reflecting a steady decline towards our interim 2030 and 2050 net zero targets.
our 2023 emissions also remain below the international energy agency's iea net zero emissions by 2050 nze reference scenario for the same year.
our financed emissions and methodological choices are also influenced by the availability of customer data and are subject to refinement when data quality improves 17 . challenges and opportunities one of the key drivers to significantly accelerate the decarbonisation of the o&g sector and meet the 1.5¬∞c-aligned 2030 and 2050 net zero targets is to ensure substantial emissions reductions across the entire value chain scopes 1, 2 and 3 through the adoption of new energy and technologies.
consequently, many o&g companies are increasingly exploring and harnessing the potential of low-carbon fuel alternatives such as biofuels, green hydrogen, green ammonia and their related derivatives , and exploring the application of carbon capture, utilisation and storage ccus solutions to conventional fossil fuel-based processes.
we will continually and proactively engage our clients to explore low-carbon fuel alternatives solutions in our region, with the aim of developing innovative structuring solutions to enhance the bankability and scalability of such opportunities.
governmental policy support and intervention will play a critical role in the decarbonisation of the o&g sector.
read more about our industry & policy engagement on page 18 to accelerate our climate agenda.
methodology for calculating absolute financed emissions furthermore, we recognise the key limitations in the current approach in quantifying our absolute financed emissions for the o&g sector.
in line with the partnership for carbon accounting financials pcaf , the absolute financed emissions per client attributable to our o&g sector is calculated by dividing our financing to the client by the client's company value and then multiplying by the client's emissions: $financed \space emissions = \sum c company \space emissions c \space x \space \frac outstanding \space amount c company \space value c $ dbs, along with many other banks, uses this pcaf methodology to calculate absolute financed emissions.
next steps our o&g sector's absolute financed emissions are tracking well against our interim 2030 target.
by utilising our in-house developed analytics tools, we will be able to monitor and simulate potential emissions trends based on different economic and environmental scenarios.
footnotes: 17 as part of our ongoing data refinement process these improvements have led to a recalculation of our emissions for the previous year, 2022, from 35.6 mtco‚ÇÇe to 28.9 mtco‚ÇÇe.
automotive 2023 performance our 2023 emissions intensity result for the automotive sector has improved to 0.111 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer, down from 0.117 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer in 2022. it remains below the reference scenario of 0.114 kgco‚ÇÇ/v-kilometer 18 . this reduction in our portfolio emissions intensity can be attributed to increased financing activities across the electric vehicle ev value chain and efforts undertaken by our automotive clients in transitioning towards evs in response to growing demand.
challenges and opportunities dbs continues to support the industry's transition to electrification by financing large gigafactories and cross-border trade flows across major markets.
we believe that these efforts will have a positive impact on our financed emissions over time as more internal combustion engine ice vehicles are replaced.
dbs remains committed to supporting our clients in their efforts towards a net zero pathway for themselves and the broader sector.
we will continue to engage with our top-emitting clients and support them in achieving decarbonisation by providing advisory services and financing for their pipeline of investments.
18 in 2022, we increased the robustness of our emissions calculations for the automotive sector through methodology updates.
among these updates, the biggest impact has been the change from the new european driving cycle nedc to worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp as the standard of measurement for emissions intensity.
as a result, emissions intensity measurements are generally higher under wltp compared to nedc.
using the wltp approach results in greater pressure to reach our interim 2030 emissions intensity target.
aviation 2023 performance our 2023 emissions intensity result for the aviation sector is 0.086 kgco‚ÇÇ/p-kilometer, a significant improvement from 0.152 kgco‚ÇÇ/p-kilometer in 2022. our portfolio position is also within the reference scenario and is on track to meeting our interim 2030 target.
challenges and opportunities airlines remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with the majority of emissions in the aviation sector coming from fuel burned during flight.
next steps we will continue to engage with our clients on their transition plans and support them through: financing their re-fleeting to more fuel-efficient aircraft; facilitating the adoption of saf, including working with our clients and other stakeholders across the aviation value chain; financing investments in novel aviation technologies, as they come to market likely post 2030 ; and/or helping clients to access high-quality offsets for their residual emissions after other decarbonisation efforts are exhausted.

19 iata net zero roadmaps executive summary june 2023 shipping a chart showing the alignment delta of the shipping sector's emissions intensity against its relevant pathway.
challenges and opportunities shipping is a hard-to-abate sector.
the key decarbonisation drivers include: higher vessel efficiency and adoption of low-carbon fuels.
examples of low-carbon fuels, such as clean ammonia, clean hydrogen, clean methanol and biofuels, offer promising alternatives to existing maritime fuels.
the higher cost of investments in more efficient ships and equipment, along with the uncertainties around the supply and cost of lower-carbon emitting fuels, are some of the ongoing challenges that ship owners face today.
2023 performance the 2023 international maritime organisation imo greenhouse gas strategy 20 on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships highlighted the increased ambitions to achieve net zero emissions from international shipping "by or around" 2050. to this end, we will evaluate our financed emissions assessment parameters for our shipping sector against this new benchmark.
in 2023, we continue to report our performance against the poseidon principles trajectory that is aligned with the 2018 imo greenhouse gas strategy.
this, in turn, is based on a 50% reduction in emissions in 2050 compared to 2008 levels, which we refer to as the 50% co‚ÇÇ reduction trajectory.
we will continue to engage with our clients on their transition journey and help facilitate the adoption of lower-carbon emitting technologies and fuels.
furthermore, we will need to direct our financing toward more efficient ships to improve our portfolio's alignment score.
20 2023 imo strategy on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships a photo showing a worker inspecting a ship's propeller.
steel 2023 performance the steel industry is one of the largest contributors of global emissions, accounting for about 7% of global emissions 21 . there are two primary technologies used in current steel production: the blast furnace ‚Äì basic oxygen furnace bf-bof and the scrap-based electric arc furnace eaf . the bf-bof technology is a carbon-intensive integrated process of iron smelted in a coal-fired blast furnace and refined into steel in a basic oxygen furnace.
in contrast, the eaf uses primary raw materials such as steel scrap, direct reduced iron dri and/or hot metal and electricity.
it is relatively less carbon-intensive and accounts for the remaining 29% of global steel production 22 . in 2023, our emissions intensity result for the steel sector improved to 1.95 kgco‚ÇÇe/kilograms steel, compared to 1.99 kgco‚ÇÇe/kilograms steel in the previous year.
this is marginally above the reference scenario determined under the mission possible partnership's tech moratorium scenario 1.83 kgco‚ÇÇe/kilograms steel . our 2023 performance has excluded upstream mining companies of iron ore and metallurgical coal from a financier's scope 3 emissions, which is in line with the sustainable steel principles ssp and practices of our peer banks.
if we had retained the original scope to include the upstream mining companies, our portfolio's financed emissions would have been 1.97 kgco‚ÇÇe/kilograms steel.
nonetheless, improvements in the financed emissions of our steel sector can be attributed to our ongoing client engagement efforts.
these include financing the use of higher-quality iron ores and fuel mix optimisation in their predominant bf-bof technologies, recycling scrap to produce secondary steel to gradually shift towards the relatively lower carbon-emitting eaf route, exploring the use of green hydrogen-based dri production and developing alternative technologies for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage ccus , among others.
we have also been providing sustainable trade facilities and structuring digital solutions for our steel clients to issue letters of credit to international council on mining and metals icmm members.
we believe these efforts will have a positive impact on the financed emissions of our steel sector over time as these get progressively reflected into our client's emissions data in the future.
to achieve the goal of decarbonisation of the steel sector, it will have to rely heavily on electrification, which fundamentally requires a change in the way steel is produced, as well as a clean grid.
despite our steel portfolio being predominantly asia-centric, the more carbon-intensive bf-bof steel production technology remains dominant ‚Äì reflecting the global steel production composition.
dbs will continue to incentivise our clients by extending sustainability-linked loans sll by setting specific targets/covenants to bring down the client's emission data.
we will also continue to fine-tune our client selection criteria to focus on clients with lower carbon footprints and clearer roadmaps for decarbonisation.
next steps we are assessing the feasibility of adopting a regional reference scenario more suited to our clients' profile and host countries' status of economic development, compared to the global version used to date.
challenges and opportunities we continue to engage with property developers and real estate investment trusts reits to encourage the reduction of emissions and we have observed a notable improvement in their commitment and initiatives to accelerate the process of decarbonisation.
decarbonisation in the real estate sector is primarily dependent on the grid and driven by adopting the highest green certification standards, promoting renewable energy generation and utilisation, and implementing energy-efficient retrofits for buildings.
accessible, accurate and automated building energy data is fundamental for understanding energy performance in decarbonisation efforts.
scaling this across a complex mix of real estate portfolio and facilities across different regions poses a challenge, which can usually be overcome with the support and collaboration among governments, policymakers, and industry participants.
this ad method has allowed us to include a much wider range of property types and countries in our real estate targets than what other banks have announced thus far.
food & agribusiness f&a data coverage % large corporate clients reporting emissions and physical output 2023 performance we remain focused on encouraging our corporate clients to measure, monitor and report their emissions and physical output.
we are encouraged by this improvement and will continue to support clients who are in the earlier stages of measuring and reporting emissions.
challenges and opportunities tangible decarbonisation requires large-scale concerted efforts from all stakeholders across the value chains from primary growers, producers, processors, transporters and distributors to government and regulatory bodies.
there are currently limited supply-side decarbonisation levers that can significantly reduce emissions from the high-emitting segments of the value chain at a commercially viable scale, while also meeting the growing demand for food.
moreover, addressing land-use change related emissions from farming is critical and requires government policy support to incentivize smallholder farmers to adopt environmentally friendly technologies.
on the demand side, shifting consumer behaviour towards more sustainable diets also requires time.
next steps while good progress is being made towards achieving our interim data coverage target, it remains challenging to set a single emissions reduction target for the entire f&a sector.
the sector is extremely diversified with emissions intensities varying materially across different agricultural produce and segments of the value chain.
we will keep abreast of industry developments and, in the absence of a single emissions target for the entire sector, will consider setting decarbonisation targets for material sub-sectors within f&a once an industry consensus on the applicable pathway emerges.
where there are gaps identified in aligning with our standards, the sustainability team, alongside the malaysian ringgit and relevant credit teams will engage the customer to address them.
for example, when the european deforestation-free regulation was rolled out in july 2023, we ran an internal training session for rms to stay abreast of its material business impacts for client engagement around their sustainable financing opportunities.
chemicals data coverage % large corporate clients reporting emissions and physical output 2023 performance we remain focused on encouraging our corporate clients to quantify, monitor and report their emissions and physical output.
we are encouraged by this improvement and will continue to support clients who are in the earlier stages of measuring and reporting emissions.
in the near term, improvements will largely be driven by enhancing process and resource efficiencies across the value chain, for example, by switching from coal to gas fuel for power.
in the longer term, nascent low-carbon technologies like green hydrogen and ccus can contribute to deeper greenhouse gas reductions when they are available at a commercial scale.
however, the applicability and impact of decarbonisation options will vary significantly across the wide spectrum of chemicals.
strong regulatory and economic frameworks will remain crucial for emissions reduction in the industry.
next steps the chemicals sector is extremely heterogeneous; companies often make a wide array of chemicals, each with different levels of emissions intensities depending on the process and use of the chemicals.
while good progress is being made towards achieving our interim data coverage target, available sector reference scenarios such as iea nze 2050 vary significantly in their starting points and trajectories due to varying inclusions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions and the types of chemicals.
hence, it remains difficult to set a single emissions reduction target for the entire chemicals sector.
we will keep abreast of industry developments and, in the absence of a single emissions target for the entire sector, will consider setting decarbonisation targets for material sub-sectors within chemicals once an industry consensus on the applicable pathway emerges.

enhancing financial planning through wealth democratisation we aim to democratise wealth through the following three-pronged approach: raising awareness of the need for financial and digital literacy for all: empowering everyone with the skills and knowledge required to navigate the financial world in this digital age.
leveraging digital and analytical tools to empower financial planning: serving our customers through our artificial intelligence ai -powered financial planning tool.
availing products and solutions to all to strengthen financial resilience: creating relevant products for our customers to achieve their financial goals.
raising awareness of the need for financial and digital literacy for all financial literacy and planning are essential for managing finances wisely and navigating the various life challenges and opportunities that arise.
as such, we are committed to enhancing financial accessibility, democratising wealth, and promoting financial planning and literacy for all.
we aim to be a one-stop solution to the financial needs of our customers, particularly those who would otherwise not have access to dedicated wealth relationship managers.
to this end, we have developed a personal finance guidance on our public website, dbs financial planning portal . this guide offers a myriad of relevant articles, events and platforms to assess suitable financial products and services, which are categorised into six key themes that reflect six major milestones in life.
the six key themes are: financial planning budgeting & debt protection investing my home retiring & estate in the portal, concise finance and investment articles, primarily presented as short-form content, are systematically categorised.
this ensures easy accessibility and relevance for our time-constrained visitors who seek to empower themselves with enhanced financial knowledge.
we also produced animated videos and organised in-person seminars and workshops to appeal to different segments of our audiences on various financial topics, such as budgeting, investing, insurance and planning for retirement.
almost 1,900 people attended in-person seminars in 2023 alone, of which over 20 were held in collaboration with other agencies such as the singapore exchange, workforce singapore, and the national library board.
in order to better understand the changing needs of the general public and provide more insightful guidance on the portal, dbs makes use of insights from its extensive customer base and customer immersion programmes.
read more about how we strengthen financial and digital support in the wider community in our financial inclusion chapter on page 40. leveraging digital and analytical tools to empower financial planning the year 2023 marked the fourth year that we have embarked on our advocacy efforts of financial planning and wellbeing.
we remain committed to creating innovative solutions that can help our customers navigate major milestones in life, such as buying their first homes, building emergency funds, saving for children, and preparing for retirement, among others.
during the year, we have further enhanced our holistic artificial intelligence ai -powered financial planning tool through plan on our digibank app to improve our customers' banking experience.
formerly known as dbs nav planner, plan is able to customise each customer's interaction according to their financial needs, risk profile, transaction behaviour and specified financial objectives, leveraging ai and machine learning ml to critically enable deeper engagement.
plan delivers real-time, intuitive, unintrusive, and hyper-personalised financial planning insights through action insights or "nudges", for our customers.
furthermore, our data analytics showed that customers who have used plan saved at least 80% more than non-users.
they also invested over four times more and were insured twice as much as non-users.
we also observed a strong interest in retirement planning with more than a two-fold increase in our customers setting retirement goals.
ceo message besides enhancing plan on our digibank app, we also launched our open architecture dbs healthcare marketplace in 2023. dbs healthcare marketplace is an aggregator site with comparator and filter functions so customers can conveniently and frictionlessly browse integrated shield plans and careshield life supplements across multiple providers, and take action to close their healthcare protection gaps to extend their hospitalization coverage and long-term disability care costs.
taking a principles-based approach, we have developed the following product solution suite at accessible price points to further strengthen financial resilience: save ‚Äì to build a strong financial foundation: an example includes our regular savings plan, invest saver , where customers can automate their investments in low-cost exchange-traded funds.
protect ‚Äì to address the rising healthcare costs: we also developed, protectfirst , a micro insurance starting from singapore dollar 5 monthly that offers customers the benefit of protection in three areas ‚Äì personal accident, critical illness, and life.
an example includes the dementia caregiver protect , which was launched in partnership with chubb insurance as a first-in-market insurance solution that provides support for dementia caregivers and care recipients.
invest - to recalibrate investments for flexibility specifically designed to address the gaps in insurance available to caregivers of people suffering from dementia, we hope to offer some respite for caregivers as we move towards building a dementia-inclusive society.
as part of the wider 'life stage investing' that we currently offer within our digibank app, we launched retirement portfolio in partnership with j.p. morgan asset management to better preserve the wealth accumulated in the earlier stages of life.
one key feature, for example, includes the individualized retirement glidepath portfolio integrated into plan with digibank app.
here, customers can indicate their desired retirement age at the point of purchase, and the portfolio will automatically 'glide' from growth to stability as the customer approaches retirement.
promoting retirement readiness amidst an aging society according to the ministry of health, singapore became an aged society in 2017 and is set to become a "super-aged" society, with one in four citizens aged 65 and above by 2026. with an aging population, coupled with volatile economic cycles and various global trends, we recognize that retirement plans may be disrupted and there will be a need for recalibration.
to this end, there is mounting urgency for singapore's residents to plan ahead for financial adequacy in retirement, through personal savings and holdings in government schemes such as cpf life and their supplementary retirement scheme srs accounts.
in 2023, we kickstarted several initiatives and introduced a number of new products and tools to enable adequate financial planning for our customers amidst the imminent shift in the demographic transition.
in partnership with manulife, we ran a retirement campaign from may to september 2023 to better prepare our customers and their retirement plans.
moreover, gaining a comprehensive and complete view of our financial health as we approach retirement can help identify and address any potential gaps early, as part of a more holistic financing planning journey.

launch of the asia impact first fund in march 2023, we announced the first close of the asia impact first fund, which we launched together with heritas capital to support innovative and high-growth social enterprises across asia to scale.
2 based on our updated methodology sustainable investment aum was 56.6% as of december 2022. financial inclusion: democratising banking services for all our approach across asia, there remains a significant number of underbanked individuals and businesses.
access to affordable and appropriate financial services is crucial for addressing rising inequality, supporting livelihoods and enabling inclusive economic growth.
at dbs, we see an opportunity to meet these underserved needs through innovative financial services that make banking more inclusive and accessible.
we aim to democratise banking services by: uplifting lives and livelihoods in our communities: to expand our reach and provide financial access to serve the underbanked who are typically excluded from traditional banking services.
boosting the playing field for micro, small and medium enterprises: to proactively address working capital requirements and strengthen capacity building in sustainability through strategic partnerships.
strengthening financial and digital support towards empowerment and self-reliance: to further educate the community at large in making and executing better financial decisions while adopting good cyber hygiene practices online.
key initiatives: uplifting lives and livelihoods in our communities lower-income and underprivileged families in singapore.
this affects the overall financial health and wellness of many, especially the most vulnerable in society.
against this backdrop, helping our customers deal with the rising cost of living is of paramount importance to dbs, as we work ever more closely with governments, businesses and community groups in a collective effort.
in 2023, dbs committed singapore dollar 40 million to help lower-income households in singapore ease the rising cost-of-living pressures.
our support includes: defraying daily expenses: dbs 5 million hawker meals ‚Äì weekly singapore dollar 3 hawker meal subsidies given to the first 100,000 users in singapore through dbs paylah app.
from february 2023, singapore residents could enjoy cashback of up to singapore dollar 3 if they are among the first 10,000 to use our dbs paylah app to scan and pay for their meals in hawker centres, every friday.
due to the overwhelming response and positive feedback received, we have extended the year-long initiative until july 2024, and we are projecting to subsidise a total of 7.5 million meals over the entire 18-month period.
bolstering savings: dbs multiplier high-yield savings programme - higher savings interest rate of 1.8% on higher balances are offered to lower-income individuals and gig-workers.
these measures are in addition to our announcement to commit up to singapore dollar 1 billion over the next 10 years to drive programmes that support lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged across our core markets.
as a purpose-driven bank, we believe that we can play a part in uplifting vulnerable and disadvantaged families and fostering a more inclusive society.
read more about our singapore dollar 1 billion commitment in the dbs foundation chapter on page 82. . work permit holders in singapore recognising that work permit holders wph , including migrant workers and migrant domestic workers, are among the most vulnerable residents in singapore, posb remains committed to onboard wph into the formal banking system.
we continue to be the only bank in singapore to do so, in collaboration with the ministry of manpower.
in our pursuit of strengthening the financial stability of wph, we delved deep into their digital banking journey, identified various obstacles and developed potential solutions that became foundational to our mission.
one of the key challenges was the apparent digital and financial literacy gap faced by many wph.
in response, the bank organised and rolled out several new and tailored initiatives during the year, which ranged from providing‚Ä¶ community stewardship amplifying our giving efforts we raised a record of more than $2.3 million to support 26 beneficiaries.
this included essential supplies and digital learning resources for disadvantaged communities.
2022 achievements : - launched heartbeat@heartlands program in singapore.
- contributed vnd100 million to poverty alleviation in vietnam.
- raised over $95,290 for pandemic recovery efforts in hong kong.
. training workshops catered for our work permit holders after-hours of training per employee support, interactive training workshops, and empowerment programmes for the self-starters to further expand our support and offerings.
we tailored our digital literacy training offerings to cater to the different needs of wph.
for example, to break down the language barrier and ensure more effective communications, we developed instructional videos with more animated elements and provided native-language voiceovers.
to further encourage active participation and build more self-confidence, the training workshops are modified to bring about a more immersive and interactive experience.
in collaboration with the migrant workers' centre, we launched the inaugural 'midigi ambassador programme', an initiative to help migrant workers overcome language barriers in picking up digital skills.
as of december 2023, around 30 migrant workers have signed up to become digital ambassadors through this programme.
they are trained to offer enhanced support to their peers in dormitories or workplaces, fostering a stronger sense of community.
we also rolled out a bi-monthly dedicated help desk at one of the key recreation centres for migrant workers, the terusan recreation centre, to provide additional banking assistance beyond our normal banking hours of training per employee.
besides enhancing digital literacy, we have also organised events and outings for our wph to places that are special and unique in singapore, such as the national art gallery and dbs sailboat rides.
we strongly believe these initiatives help foster a stronger sense of belonging and enjoyment within our community and underscore our dedication to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of the diverse communities we serve.
. dbs sailboat rides organised for our work permit holders priority sectors in india as part of our larger focus on responsible banking, our india franchise - dbs bank india limited dbil - has increased lending to specific sectors and categories of borrowers that are typically underserved when it comes to accessing formal credit.
with dedicated efforts in the past few years, dbil has been making a positive impact in the following areas: agriculture ‚Äì lending to farmers including women in rural india for allied agriculture activities and for improving sanitation.
with the specific goal of empowering women in rural india, we embarked on our journey of on-lending to micro-finance institutions mfis in 2020. these mfis provide targeted financing to women in the rural areas specialised in income-generation activities such as allied agriculture, handicrafts, small businesses, among others.
they also provide loans for the construction of toilets and piped water connections to improve sanitation and the quality of life and health in the remote rural hinterlands of india.
to date, we have successfully supported about half a million women to achieve financial independence and their entrepreneurial aspirations.
to achieve this, we have entered into an agreement with water.org, a leading non-profit organisation, to support our partner micro finance institutions to develop financial products and also provide technical training for wash loans.
to date, dbil has partnered with seven such institutions with an overall disbursement of singapore dollar 8.7 million, supporting over 20,000 families.
durga, a 45-year-old lady, lives in her village gokul nagar, karnataka along with her two sons and husband.
durga came to know about wash loans offered by iifl samasta, one of the partner financial institutions of the bank.
she obtained a loan of singapore dollar 400 to construct a toilet with piped water connection which, as an exception to the norm, was not dependent on any governmental welfare scheme.
the unorganized agricultural residue supply chain has not adequately incentivized and financed farmers and aggregators.
compressed biogas cbg , a purified compressed bio-gas with similar calorific value and properties to compressed natural gas cng , is carbon neutral and increasingly used as a green renewable automotive fuel.
in addition to being an alternative fuel aligning with the global shift towards cleaner energy, cbg benefits india's local agricultural economy by providing farmers with additional revenue streams and avoiding penalties for burning agricultural waste.
reliance industries limited, recognizing cbg's importance in its net-zero roadmap, plans to invest nationwide to produce cbg as an alternative to imported cng and other fossil fuels, making india a prominent biofuel source.
in 2023, dbs collaborated with reliance to develop a supply chain financing program.
dbs bank india customized its standard supply chain financing model to meet project requirements.
this financing enabled the development of an ecosystem for vendor partners to aggregate agricultural residue for cbg production plants across india.
the funding structure ensured the logistics remained competitive and achieved enhanced commercial scale.
reliance plans to set up approximately 100 cbg plants over the next 5 years, consuming over 5.5 million total weight of recycled waste, including electronic waste of agricultural residue and organic waste annually, resulting in an estimated reduction of about 2 million total weight of recycled waste, including electronic waste of carbon dioxide emissions.
dbs bank is renowned for its expertise in supply chain financing and goes beyond traditional banking to enable responsible solutions for large enterprises, their supplier networks as well as small and medium businesses by empowering them to streamline operations for enhanced efficiency.
the bank's extensive asian network and deep expertise in customizing sustainable solutions enable businesses to mitigate risks and seize growth opportunities.‚Äù boosting the level playing field for micro, small, and medium enterprises msmes addressing working capital requirements among msmes the post-pandemic era presented more challenges than anticipated.

for example: to get them started on their sustainability journeys, we are co-developing a digital self-assessment tool exclusively designed for smes.
the tool enables businesses to review and evaluate their sustainability efforts and recommend actions for progress across their approach to governance, strategy, risk management, and setting meaningful metrics and targets.
to help smes kickstart their decarbonisation journey, we are partnering with several carbon management platform providers to offer simplified online platforms for smes to input and assess their direct carbon emission and datasets.

we continue to advance our sustainability agenda through a proactive and multifaceted approach that focuses on minimizing negative environmental impact rather than relying on reactive measures like purchasing offsets.
by adopting a life-cycle perspective, we strive to identify and address environmental challenges at every stage of our operations.
to address our carbon, energy, water and waste footprint, we have developed a four-lever approach to systematically drive progress based on prioritizing our efforts in the following order: lever 1: reduce consumption of resources lever 2: generate renewable energy lever 3: purchase green products and energy lever 4: purchase renewable energy certificates renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets note on data quality and coverage to improve our data quality, we are continually enhancing our data governance, systems, and processes.
across our locations, our operational environmental data is collated from different sources, including metered data, utility bills, and landlord statements, amongst others.
all operational environmental data disclosures in this report are subject to rigorous internal checking and review, with selected indicators also subject to external assurance as detailed on pages 97 to 101. in 2023, dbs completed the acquisition of citigroup inc.'s consumer banking business in taiwan citi consumer taiwan . however, the integration of citi consumer taiwan's environmental data is still underway and is therefore excluded from the scope of our reporting on operational environmental footprint.
key initiatives reducing consumption of resources our first priority is to reduce resource consumption and increase operational efficiency in our operations e.grams., office buildings, bank branches, energy systems, etc. . energy reduction and management approach we reduce our energy consumption through a series of operational energy reduction and efficiency initiatives.
we have designed net-zero-energy retrofits for these and other offices in our portfolio, and we are assessing implementation of these retrofits.
we also consistently install occupancy sensors for lights and cooling in all new spaces whenever feasible, in line with our principle of using energy only where necessary.
in 2023, our operational energy consumption was 121,357 megawatt-hours and our carbon emissions were 53,446 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
while this marks an increase from the previous year, we have continued to neutralize our carbon footprint through investing in high-quality carbon offset projects that are independently verified and certified.
while offsetting, our strategy remains to prioritize efforts that improve energy efficiency, increase the production and use of renewables, and implementing sustainable practices across our operations to minimize our footprint.
read more about our approach to carbon offsetting on page 62. green mark platinum certification for over 80% of our manned retail bank branches since 2017, we have been pursuing opportunities to redesign our branches to be more resource-efficient and carbon-light by: integrating intelligent occupancy-based lighting and air-conditioning systems to minimize energy consumption.
implementing water-efficient fittings and dedicated meters to minimize and monitor water consumption.
introducing green features and innovation such as video teller machines that are equipped with energy-saving light dimmers and sensor controls to enhance efficiency and customer service.
we will continue to integrate environmentally conscious practices at every level as much as possible such as supply chain sustainability, waste reduction and management initiatives through materials and fittings used in the design of the space.
our target is to have 100% of our branches certified green mark platinum in singapore by the end of 2024. . table 1: our energy and carbon footprint 1 : 2023 : energy : total energy consumption megawatt-hours 2 , singapore: 65,832, hong kong: 10,041, china: 5,480, taiwan: 6,394, india: 19,313, indonesia: 12,670, international centres: 1,627 3 , total: 121,357 : energy intensity by total income megawatt-hours/ singapore dollar million , singapore: 4.91, hong kong: 3.12, china: 8.88, taiwan: 11.69, india: 29.76, indonesia: 19.37, international centres: 1.90, total: 6.09 : a from non-renewables megawatt-hours 4 , singapore: 64,816, hong kong: 10,041, china: 5,480, taiwan: 6,331, india: 19,135, indonesia: 12,408, international centres: 1,627, total: 119,838 : b from renewables production megawatt-hours , singapore: 1,016, hong kong: 0, china: 0, taiwan: 63, india: 178, indonesia: 262, international centres: 0, total: 1,519 : purchased renewable energy certificates megawatt-hours 5 , singapore: 0, hong kong: 10,100, china: 5,500, taiwan: 0, india: 19,200, indonesia: 13,000, international centres: 0, total: 47,800 : carbon 6 : total carbon emissions, market-based tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 7 = a + b ii + c , singapore: 37,402, hong kong: 2,299, china: 2,180, taiwan: 3,245, india: 3,886, indonesia: 3,084, international centres: 1,350, total: 53,446 : total carbon emission intensity, market-based, by total income tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent/ singapore dollar million 8 , singapore: 2.79, hong kong: 0.72, china: 3.53, taiwan: 5.93, india: 5.99, indonesia: 4.72, international centres: 1.57, total: 2.68 : a scope 1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 9 , singapore: 217, hong kong: 22, china: 0, taiwan: 0, india: 147, indonesia: 196, international centres: 0, total: 582 : b scope 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 10 : i. gross location-based , singapore: 16,265, hong kong: 4,980, china: 2,068, taiwan: 2,653, india: 11,852, indonesia: 7,185, international centres: 794, total: 45,797 : ii.

we did not include employee ground transport emissions from the lvb portfolio in india.
we do not include any carbon footprint from items that were repurposed, gifted, or sold.
currently our scope 3 does not include any other upstream carbon from operational procurement.
12 this figure refers to scope 3 emissions of business flights attributed to singapore, taiwan, indonesia, and china; based on aggregated source data provided by our travel agencies, ctrip for china and egencia for the remainder . this figure also includes carbon emissions from our courier dhl, for the first time this year.
14 our international centres ics are mostly single offices in office buildings in their respective cities, and we do not yet have access to landlord water and waste data.
the water and waste footprint of our ics is not material to our overall consumption figures.
we do not include water and waste data from our ics.
15 in 2023, we included lvb water use indicator data into these tables under the india market, in addition to electricity consumption, diesel genset consumption, petrol genset consumption, and pv production disclosed since lvb's incorporation in 2022. 16 all water consumption reported is considered freshwater according to gri 303; 1,000 cubic metres cubic meters is equivalent to one megalitre.
17 water stress was assessed using wri.org tool 'aqueduct water risk atlas' where "stressed" - " 40% at risk".
18 waste data from lvb is not included in scope.
generating renewable energy as our second priority, we aim to generate renewable energy to replace more carbon-intensive energy sources.
our total renewable energy production rose from 1,362 megawatt-hours in 2022 to 1,519 megawatt-hours in 2023. in 2023, we grew our renewable energy production with an additional solar installation on ck street in india.
looking ahead, we endeavor to continue to scale our renewable energy production and consumption.
purchasing renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets despite our efforts to reduce consumption, as well as generating and purchasing renewable energy, gross carbon emissions still persist in our operations.
while we explore future opportunities to avoid, reduce, and replace these residual carbon emissions, we continue to compensate for them through the purchase of renewable energy certificates and carbon credits.
dbs' approach to carbon credits carbon credits can be an efficient tool to unlock capital required to transition our global economies to a net-zero future.
there are various nature- and technology-based solutions that facilitate the avoidance, reduction, or removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, all of which can generate carbon credits to support the net-zero transition.
we recognize that carbon credits can be controversial.
there is fear that carbon credits from poorly managed carbon-bearing projects can overstate the offsetting activity, and by so doing, reduce the pressure for gross decarbonisation.
the voluntary carbon markets vcms have also faced various challenges this year such as allegations of fraudulent credits which has undermined confidence in the market.
nonetheless, there were positive developments such as the establishment and release of standards for high-integrity carbon credits, as well as guidance for companies who use them.
in 2023, we strengthened our approach to purchasing renewable energy certificates and carbon credits by updating our carbon offset guide, improving the governance and processes around the selection and purchase of energy attribute certificates e.grams., renewable energy certificates and carbon credits.
we applied the enhanced processes to mitigate all residual emissions in our operations after our energy reduction and renewable energy initiatives.
recs : we purchased a total of 47,800 megawatt-hours of renewable energy certificates to compensate for all 100% of grid electricity consumption across our core markets outside of singapore and taiwan.
carbon credits : we purchased 55,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of high-quality carbon avoidance credits from a nature-based project.
these projects deliver positive climate impacts but also support important social and economic development opportunities for local communities, further contributing to the united nations sustainable development goals.
read more on our data on energy and carbon emission on page 60. in 2022, we updated our carbon offset guide, which covers our general approach to carbon credits and provides a governance framework related to the purchase of carbon credits for the purpose of offsetting remaining operational gross emissions at dbs.
in 2023, we further updated our guide to strengthen our due diligence approach, clarify our selection criteria and widen the scope of eligible registries we look at, taking into consideration market developments.
we will leverage the expertise of these organizations to understand the level of risks faced by the projects we are looking at.
as part of our overall process, we are committed to using the best available information at the time of purchase to ensure that we select high-quality and impactful carbon credits from meaningful projects.
given the rapidly developing landscape in global vcms, we will continually review our carbon offset guide to ensure it remains sufficiently robust.

these wares composed of rice husks and starch, can be kept within the biological cycle at the end of the wares' useful life.
shortened receipts issued at ordering kiosks by almost 50% to reduce our paper use.
3. sustainable transport dbs aimed to reduce emissions from our employee transportation services by converting to more sustainable modes of transportation.
as a result, total fuel consumption from the conversion dropped by 63% from 55,112 l to 20,358 l as well as a reduction in total distance travelled from 673,000 kilometer to 61,000 kilometer thereby reducing fuel consumption too.
guided by our vision to be the best bank for a better world, we integrate environmental and social considerations into our procurement decision-making, alongside financial factors.
our supply chain management programme includes: accelerating a restorative enterprise: to grow restorative procurement together with our ecosystem partners adopting a risk management approach: to utilise a comprehensive set of processes and tools in an iterative manner to manage our supply base investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain: to ensure a diverse and efficient supply base that is continually supported through supplier engagement and training key initiatives accelerating a restorative enterprise since 2021, the restorative procurement framework "framework" has guided our partnerships with suppliers, as we work towards building a restorative enterprise.
we integrate these restorative principles directly into our procurement processes, including our ssp and approach to screening, prioritising, assessing and engaging our suppliers.
this promotes not only "doing less harm" but also "doing more good" across our supply chain.
an illustrative framework of how dbs conducts restorative procurement restorative approach in action during the recent closure of multiple premises in indonesia due to branch relocations or mergers, we successfully collected over 100 pieces of security equipment, including cctv cameras and keypad readers.
adopting a risk management approach at dbs, we conduct due diligence on our supplier base and adopt a risk-based approach to the governance of sustainability in our supply chains see figure 2 . we utilize a comprehensive set of processes and tools in an iterative manner to govern our supplier base, which consists of thousands of regional suppliers across diverse spend categories.
to enhance objectivity, fairness, and transparency within the sustainability criteria during supplier evaluations, we have also crafted the criteria to be more quantifiable and verifiable.
we have rolled this out through a pilot program, which specifically targets higher-risk category items with higher-value contracts.
we also continued to employ our ssp as the primary screening mechanism for all new suppliers as part of the onboarding process.
in 2023, we successfully onboarded close to 800 suppliers across our core markets, with more than 99% of new suppliers aligned with our enhanced ssp.
going forward, onboarded suppliers who do not commit to aligning with the ssp will be enrolled into our sustainability ratings exercise, which will help us to mitigate any potential risks and monitor the sustainability performance of these suppliers.
uplifting our sustainable sourcing principles as part of our ongoing uplift of our ssp, we made significant strides to further promote the principles of restorative procurement amongst our suppliers.
we require suppliers to implement appropriate programs or policies to manage their environmental impact.
we have also added a clause to encourage suppliers to go beyond doing less harm and adopt restorative approaches that create a net zero or net positive impact on the environment and society.
to address human rights, we have incorporated enhancements to secure commitments from our suppliers for the equitable remuneration and health and safety of workers, and the well-being of local communities.
additionally, we emphasize our requirement for suppliers to take appropriate measures to remediate any adverse human rights and environmental impacts that may result from their products or services.
this commitment extends further to include a grievance mechanism for addressing and resolving any human rights impacts that may arise in our supply chain.
these enhancements underscore our dedication to advancing sustainability and ethical business practices within our procurement processes.
we encourage our suppliers to actively share dbs' ssp with their next-tier suppliers and business partners to create a broader impact and foster alignment with responsible practices throughout the supply chain.
as part of our supplier engagement initiatives, we actively work to enhance the capabilities of our suppliers and fortify our partnerships to build a restorative enterprise.
in our recent sustainability workshops for suppliers, we underscored the significance of our ssp, highlighted forthcoming modifications, and offered our suppliers the chance to seek clarifications.
this proactive approach prepares suppliers for upcoming enhancements and fosters more collaborative partnerships.
prioritize and assess: with thousands of suppliers in our supply base, we need to prioritize and focus our attention on the most important areas.
since 2022, we have partnered with a global sustainability ratings provider, ecovadis, to assess high-risk suppliers.
suppliers are evaluated based on their commitments to the environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement.
as a recognition of their efforts, dbs has extended the acknowledgement period for suppliers achieving a silver, gold, or platinum ecovadis medal beyond the standard one-year validity stipulated by ecovadis.
our network on the ecovadis platform now consists of over 200 dbs suppliers with scorecards adhering to the validity period defined by dbs.
by expanding our supplier network on the platform, we enhance transparency in our supply chain sustainability performance.
this supports our commitment to fostering a responsible and resilient business ecosystem.
embedding human rights due diligence in our procurement practices we are committed to doing business with respect for human rights through our sustainable procurement practices.
our first line of defense is the requirement for all new suppliers to be screened by our ssp.
as part of our ssp uplift mentioned on page 65, we have incorporated enhancements to the human rights clauses within the principles by drawing on standards and guidance set by leading international frameworks, including those established by the united nations un and the international labour organization ilo . specifically, our enhanced ssp require that suppliers: champion human rights by prohibiting human trafficking, slavery, harassment, and abuse prohibit child labor promote diversity and inclusion protect the health and safety of workers uphold fair and equitable remuneration of workers engage: we view engagement as an integral part of our ongoing collaboration with suppliers.
as part of our engagement strategy, we aim to support and work with our suppliers to improve their sustainability performance.
additionally, we actively seek to improve the sustainability of our supply chain by enrolling suppliers who are assessed as high risk to participate in our sustainability training workshops.
with participation from over 25 suppliers and 70 dbs employees from group procurement services, including sourcing managers, this training workshop highlighted our commitment to promoting sustainability across our supply chain.
moving ahead, we will continue our approach of engaging and training suppliers to adapt to the market's evolving sustainability requirements.
this remains key for us in managing potential risks and improving the overall transparency of our supply chain.
to protect against supply chain disruptions to protect us against supply chain disruptions amidst uncertainties from geopolitical and economic situations, in 2022 we established a hardware resiliency framework to drive visibility, agility, and resilience in supply chain processes.
through this framework, we focus on proactively engaging key vendors to gain insights into their delivery lead times and supply risk mitigation strategies.
this enables us to better detect any potential risks of delivery delays and work with our stakeholders to source for alternate solutions.
in addition, we also continue to improve our processes to meet market standards and ensure adherence to our delivery commitments.
we are committed to continuously update the framework based on evolving vendor structures and relationships influenced by globalization.
technology resilience including cyber security fortifying resilience and security our approach technology is critical to our business strategy and processes.
however, the growing complexity of our technology stack and network infrastructure, coupled with rising cyber threats, presents a growing risk for our business.
in 2023, the occurrence of digital disruptions that interrupted our service served as a catalyst for further enhancing our resilience.
in addition, dbs remains resolute in our commitment to fortify our cyber security capabilities against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, ensuring the delivery of safe and secure banking services to our customers.
the ongoing targeting of our customer base by cyber threat actors who employ sophisticated tactics like social engineering, phishing scams, and mobile malware, coupled with the escalating risk of cyberattacks on our online banking services and technology infrastructure amid geopolitical tensions, underscores the imperative for us to continue to invest in and explore the latest advancements in cyber security technologies.
we have since tightened our change management controls and created a near-production test environment to allow for more robust testing of key services before going live with new changes or releases.
to prevent this, we are decoupling these shared systems at both the front and back ends so that key services are always available on at least one channel.
this will be completed by q1 2024. to complement our engagement with vendors, we have established 10 centres of excellence coes that house expertise across different domains.
our cyber security control environment is regularly tested and attained the highest tier of preparedness for the cyber trust mark.
incident management when incidents arise, we have to recover services more quickly.
having early warning indicators, and a process to review internal alerts proactively, enables us to take preventive actions in a timely manner.
in the last year, having built comprehensive diagnostic capabilities, real-time monitoring data and alerts are now being leveraged as part of our incident management process.
we have centralized our command center to enable faster identification, triaging, and initiation of recovery protocols.
playbooks for technology operations teams and crisis situation managers have been updated with a sharper focus on rapid restoration of alternate systems to minimize interruption of our digital services.
we also bolstered our site reliability engineering team with new leadership and established a dedicated quality assurance function, the latter which serves as an independent layer of checks on change management within group technology.
cyber security cyber security remains a cornerstone of our technology resilience approach as we continue to digitalise our business and operations.
we continue to achieve external verifications and certifications that underscore our dedication to maintaining high standards of information security.
some of our 2023 highlights are: achieved iso27001 certification for information security management systems achieved singapore cyber trust mark ctm certification at the advocate level our robust data protection policies and practices are also certified by t√ºv s√ºd, an external independent certification body in 2023, we continued to improve our cyber security capabilities through: investing in our cyber defence capabilities we enhanced our cyber defence capabilities through the following: enhanced and secured our mobile applications using solutions such as runtime application self-protection rasp , ensuring a continued safe banking experience for customers.
the enhanced control detects the presence of malware, prevents unauthorised access on compromised devices, and guides dbs customers to remove malicious mobile applications.

this ensures that our incident response capabilities are aligned with the latest threat intelligence and are adapted to the emerging and ever-changing cyber exploits.
continued to expand the scope of our monitoring as we expanded the adoption of public cloud and new cloud technologies, automated the response and investigation of cyber security events and alerts, and enhanced the use cases for our cyber security incident detection and mitigation.
validated the efficacy of our incident detection and response capabilities in our adversarial attack simulation exercise where the attack attempts were promptly detected and neutralised.
staying vigilant through knowledge sharing and ecosystem partnerships the interconnected nature of cyber threats and their contagion effect necessitates a comprehensive and collective response from the financial industry and the wider ecosystem.
in view of mobile malware targeting our customers, we participated in an industry effort to share best practices in mobile application security.
for example, we implement and operate runtime application self-protection rasp to safeguard our mobile applications against malware.
enhancing cyber security governance our robust cyber security capabilities and management are underpinned by strong governance and oversight.
we enhanced the risk awareness of our technology staff by implementing a targeted technology and cyber risk training curriculum.
this was delivered through a combination of online elearning modules and in-person seminars across our six core markets.
the training covered a range of technology risk management and cyber security topics.
we further hosted the application security conference which was attended by 875 participants.
this platform provided an opportunity to update our developers on key advancements in the areas of software testing and generative ai.
cyberwellness programme for the community the dbs cyberwellness programme leverages the bank's expertise to empower employees of social enterprises and charities in the aspect of cyber security awareness.
through the comprehensive training provided, participants are equipped with knowledge to identify and effectively respond to cyber threats, thereby contributing to a safer digital environment.

arculus is designed to be scalable and enable regional expansion while enhancing data security and privacy engineering capabilities.
this ensures secure delivery of accurate data to the right individuals at the right time.
we successfully conducted a proof-of-concept exercise for a new privacy engineering technique known as synthetic data.
this method creates a 'synthetic twin' of a real dataset, replacing all personal information with artificial values while preserving key statistical properties.
our governance architecture ensures that data-related risks are managed at the operational, senior management, and board levels.
ceo message in 2023, we enhanced our governance architecture to better align key committees overseeing data-related risks.
specifically, our data governance committee dgc and responsible data use rdu committees will now become sub-committees of group operational risk committee gorc and group risk executive committee respectively.
in turn, data-related risk will be escalated to the board risk management committee brmc via these sub-committees in 2024. this governance structure increases the awareness and oversight of data-related risks from an operational level through to board level.
it is imperative for us to consistently address the ethical dimensions of our use of data to ensure we remain aligned with the bank's core values.
to uphold the pure principles amid evolving regulations, changing customer expectations, and societal norms, we have enhanced our pure portal to ensure automatic notifications to all relevant parties when data use cases are due for review.
we furthered our commitment to training and awareness by introducing the digital pure practitioner module.
the move to digital-based content increased the accessibility of the training to our dbs colleagues across our core markets.
furthermore, we have also included a pure learning component to our new joiner curriculum to underline the importance of responsible data use to all dbs employees, irrespective of their role.
the pure process ensures we continuously strive to build trust with our customers, employees, stakeholders, and the communities we live and operate in.
model governance e.grams., artificial intelligence - how we use it?
at dbs, our ai adoption is guided by three principles: data safety, responsible utilization, and stringent privacy.
the bank has engineered two in-house solutions: advancing dbs with ai ada for unified data governance, and alan 1 , an award-winning ai protocol for scalable and rapid ai deployment.
ada and alan, when used together, enable our teams to swiftly build and deploy ai models, enhancing our operations and decision-making capabilities.
ada and alan incorporate specific governance requirements and stringent controls e.grams., data classification, data reconciliation, approval workflows, etc. to ensure essential governance considerations are addressed throughout the development lifecycle.
we also continue to work closely with regulators and industry bodies to gradually enhance our overall approach and strengthen core governance controls.
generative artificial intelligence gen ai the rapid emergence and evolution of gen ai in late 2022 have garnered global attention, spanning governments, academia, corporates, regulators, and the general public.
initial enthusiasm was quickly met with a series of restrictions, lawsuits, and national bans on gen ai solution deployment, conflicting perspectives from notable figures and entities, and the early implementation of gen ai guidance and regulations across numerous jurisdictions.
by the end of 2023, a more robust consensus emerged regarding the responsible utilization of gen ai, emphasizing the optimization of the technology's capabilities and benefits while effectively addressing any inherent risks.
at dbs, we believe that embracing gen ai has the potential to benefit not only our customers and employees but also society at large, aligning with our commitment to help people 'live more, bank less'.
specifically, the exciting opportunities presented by gen ai, such as simplifying and supporting everyday tasks, as well as creating new content, services, and products, are applicable across all industries.
our initial experiments and pilots with gen ai are primarily internal and designed with high levels of human oversight and incremental progression.
as an added layer of protection, we have also: established a cross-functional responsible ai rai taskforce comprising senior and experienced subject matter experts from across many of our core functions, including cyber security, legal and compliance, data science, technology and infrastructure, data management, and risk management.
this ensures that we can leverage the appropriate expertise to thoroughly evaluate our use case pilots and provide guidance on mitigating any potential risks.
utilized our existing pure and ai/ml governance frameworks to ensure our use cases are ethical, lawful, regulatory compliant, aligned with the bank's core values and are appropriately owned, approved, and managed.
this gives added assurance that gen ai use cases have been holistically assessed and approved by senior management and subject matter experts prior to any measurable deployment.
emphasis is placed on areas such as people and change management, building enterprise capabilities, value realization, responsible ai, and technology enablement.
a regular cadence has also been established with group management committee gmc members to ensure senior management direction and oversight.
to supplement this, we have also provided enhanced fairness practitioner training to our data science teams as part of the rollout.

the csa translates the effects of policy and regulation changes, technology development, and changes in consumer preferences as defined by a set of standard climate scenarios for example, from the network of greening the financial system ngfs into impacts to key financial drivers identified for each sector.
scenario data include, for example, primary, secondary, and final energy consumption, emissions data, carbon price, price indices for key energy variables.
a total of nine sectors selected based on their significance within the ibg portfolio and carbon emissions contribution were included in the transition risk scenario analyses.
physical risk the forward-looking physical risk analysis is conducted based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 1 as described below: very high climate change scenario ssp5-8.5 : low mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions triple by 2075 and global average temperatures rise by 3.3-5.7 ¬∞c by 2100. high climate change scenario ssp3-7.0 : limited mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions double by 2100 and global average temperatures rise by 2.8-4.6 ¬∞c by 2100. intermediate climate change scenario ssp2-4.5 : strong mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions stabilize around current levels until 2050 and then decline but not reaching net zero by 2100. this scenario is expected to result in global average temperatures rising by 2.1-3.5 ¬∞c by 2100. low climate change scenario ssp1-2.6 : aggressive mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions reduce to net zero by 2050, resulting in global average temperatures rising by 1.3-2.4 ¬∞c by 2100. limitations climate risk scenario analysis is an important tool to assess the resilience of a bank's business models and strategies to a range of plausible climate-related pathways, and to determine the impact of climate-related risk drivers on overall risk profile.
meanwhile, since the area of climate scenario analysis and the associated modelling is still evolving and an industry standard has yet to emerge, it is important that the uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario analysis are understood to ensure that the results are interpreted and used appropriately: 1. climate scenarios: with the growth in scenario analysis use cases, and as industry practitioners and regulators gain more insights therefrom, ongoing updates and improvements of the scenarios are expected and noted on ngfs scenarios.
2. extended horizon: time horizon of over 30 years is typical of scenario analysis e.grams., transition risk analysis typically goes to at least 2050 to align with net zero goal horizon, while physical risk analysis can be of longer horizon . this is much longer than typical business planning horizon, with uncertainties arising from technological development, demographic change, and climate tipping point events, among others.
3. data: bottom-up firm level analysis requires granular data such as absolute emissions or intensity for various scope of a firm's activities, which currently varies in terms of availability, granularity, and accuracy.
with the ongoing improvement of data availability and updates in scenarios and tools available in the market, it is expected that the methodology of modelling the transmission mechanism of climate-related financial risks be further fine-tuned over time.
with the focus on climate risk scenario analysis by the industry and regulators, it is expected that continuous effort will be invested to address such limitations over the next couple of years.

practitioner‚Äôs independence and quality management we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the accounting and corporate regulatory authority acra code of professional conduct and ethics for public accountants and accounting entities acra code , which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
our firm applies singapore standard on quality management 1 which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
we performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with singapore standard on assurance engagements 3000 revised ‚Äì assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions included in the identified sustainability information, singapore standard on assurance engagements 3410 ‚Äì assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements collectively, the "standards" . these standards require that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion about whether the identified sustainability information is free from material misstatement.
given the circumstances of the engagement, we also performed the following: interviewed management and personnel in group procurement services, group human resources, and corporate real estate strategy & administration in relation to the identified sustainability information; obtained an understanding of how the identified sustainability information is gathered, collated and aggregated internally; performed limited substantive testing, on a selective basis, of the identified sustainability information i to verify the assumptions, estimations and computations made in relation to the selected sustainability information; and ii to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported, to the extent we considered necessary and appropriate to provide sufficient evidence for our conclusion; and assessed the disclosure and presentation of the identified sustainability information.
the quantification of the greenhouse gas emissions data underlying the identified sustainability information is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases, and the estimation uncertainty from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.
this can affect the ability to draw meaningful comparison of the company's greenhouse gas emissions over time.
