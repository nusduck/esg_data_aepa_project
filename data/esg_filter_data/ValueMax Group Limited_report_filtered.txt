tcfd report 2022 task force on climate-related financial disclosures report valuemax tcfd report 2022 task force on climate-related financial disclosures reflecting the financial sector's commitment to addressing climate change, valuemax proposed a set of recommendations for consistent disclosures on climate-related financial disclosures tcfd in october 2022 to help our stakeholders better understand our climate-related risks.
valuemax publicly expressed our support for the tcfd recommendations for the first time.
we are publishing our climate disclosures this year, following the structure provided by tcfd recommendations.
this is a part of the 2022 sustainability report and summarized in this dedicated tcfd extract.
these included quantitative metrics alongside explanations of the frameworks and overall valuemax climate strategy.
valuemax will continue our tcfd implementation efforts through 2023, following the recommendations across the four tcfd categories of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
page 56 of the sustainability report 2022. governance efforts taken by valuemax to implement climate-related recommendations as a global financial institution, we recognize the important role that we play in combating climate change through support of the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient global economy.
valuemax pursues a three-pronged approach in addressing climate change and climate-related risks.
first, we are in collaboration with the industry to work towards transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient business models, and integrating climate change into our risk management model.
third, we are working on further reducing the carbon footprint of our own operations and supply chain.
governance of sustainability is exercised through the established governance bodies of the group.
sustainability governance framework board of directors the board approves and monitors the materiality matrix and sustainability strategy.
the management team the management team has determined focus areas where valuemax can have the greatest economic, environmental and social impact, as well as the areas that are most important to our stakeholders.
we engage our internal and external stakeholders to understand their concerns, expectations and emerging priorities.
this enables us to initiate collaboration and be part of formulating or facilitating a solution, building mutually beneficial relationships.
valuemax tcfd report 2022 board responsibilities the board, or a committee delegated by it, is responsible for: approving an environmental risk management framework and policies to assess and manage valuemax's environmental risk exposures on an ongoing basis; setting clear roles and responsibilities of board and senior management, including personnel who are responsible for oversight of the valuemax's environmental risk; and ensuring that directors have adequate understanding of environmental risk and senior management is equipped with appropriate expertise for managing environmental risk.
management team responsibilities the management team is responsible for: ensuring the development and implementation of environmental risk management framework and policies, as well as tools and metrics to monitor exposures to environmental risk, including resilience of the valuemax's strategy to different environmental scenarios; reviewing regularly the effectiveness of the framework, policies, tools and metrics and making appropriate revisions, taking into account changes in valuemax's risk profile and business strategies; establishing an internal escalation process for managing environmental risk and ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken to address the risk; updating the board on material environmental risk issues in a timely manner and allocating adequate resources with appropriate expertise, including through capacity building and training, to manage the valuemax's environmental risk.
managing the financial impact arising from climate change therefore aligns fully with our objectives.
climate change introduces risks, but also opportunities.
in particular, the actions societies take to mitigate and adapt to climate change can result in structural changes to the economy.
the transition to a low carbon economy will benefit some sectors and companies at the expense of others, and will create correspondingly differentiated impact on company values.
we first report these risks in valuemax tcfd report 2022 and plan to continue to enhance the identification and assessment of these risks through a more quantitative and comprehensive analysis across our businesses throughout 2023. general classification of climate-related risks and opportunities we recognize climate change as one of the most significant risks facing our planet.
climate risk is central to our sustainability agenda at valuemax, as we look to limit the impacts that result from the transitional or physical effects of climate change.
we continue to work on the measures required to address climate change, in support of a transition towards lower-carbon operations and products.
climate-related opportunities relate to efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as resource efficiencies and cost savings, the adoption of low-emission energy sources, the development of new services, wider access to the market, and building resilience within the company.
valuemax tcfd report 2022: climate-related risks table: climate-related risks manifestations and horizon: financial, precious metal and stones prices: due to the environmental impact of mining for precious metals and stones, the supply chain might be disrupted with new environmental regulations in place.
valuemax actively promotes transition, but also depends on suppliers and clients to engage, commit and deliver on commitments towards "net zero" in a collaborative effort., loss of credibility during execution: we are committed to play a role in sustainability.
responsibilities towards climate-related compliance might put pawnshops under increased supervision of the national creditors such as banks which will affect our credit and liquidity.
valuemax tcfd report 2022 climate-related opportunities category: financing , initiatives: valuemax could have a new lending scheme to fund green or climate-related projects or technologies that are expected to play an important role in decarbonizing the economy "green loans" . offering sustainability-linked loans whose pricing is based on the borrower's esg score or overall sustainability achievements., time horizon: short term to long term category: products and services , initiatives: buying recycled jewellery brings forth the cause towards consumption of sustainable and ethical jewellery.
fashion trends and consumer tastes towards increased demand for sustainable jewellery and less demand for new jewellery to counter the effects of mining, creating less waste, might lead to the increase in demand for secondhand jewellery., time horizon: short term to long term category: resource and energy efficiency , initiatives: improve energy efficiency of current office space and capture cost-savings.
source third-party suppliers with improved energy and carbon performance aligned with industry best practice., time horizon: short term to long term category: employees engagement , initiatives: encourage employees to take climate-related actions in the office, expand employee training and benefit programs that reduce carbon emissions through more efficient modes of travel., time horizon: short term to long term table end.
they may also be major employers in economically weak regions.
as such, responsible economic activity can be a significant driver for sustainable development.
the activities of valuemax do not have a similarly significant impact on the climate, biodiversity, water resources or local communities.
we may also face increased operational expenditure, for example, if the cost of natural resource use increases, or if a carbon price is introduced.
as government introduces new policies to limit climate change and to protect natural resources, the materiality of these financial impacts is likely to increase.

valuemax faces mostly transition risks instead of physical risks of climate change.
transition risks are those associated with the pace and extent at which an organization manages and adapts to the internal and external pace of change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy.
transitioning requires policy and legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.
by systematically measuring, reporting, and evaluating energy consumption and emissions, we set the foundation for, and are committed to, continuous improvements in our environmental performance.
relevant environmental data on design, materials, operational matters, energy efficiency and ergonomics are considered in the planning and construction of new premises and facilities.
carbon footprint of valuemax' corporate activities valuemax will continue to measure and report our corporate emissions using the greenhouse gas greenhouse gas protocol.
based on singapore's grid emission factor of 0.4057 kilograms of co2 per kilowatt-hour that was last revised in 2021, valuemax generated approximately 573.8 tonnes of co2 equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions across scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions in fy2022.
the scope 1 direct emissions declined 17.2% from fy2018 baseline despite the growth in the revenue.

valuemax tcfd report 2022 carbon emission profile valuemax will introduce new metrics to report our energy utilization.
the metrics are computed as follows: scope 1 direct company vehicles: the distance covered when transporting goods from the office to valuemax-owned stores, multiplied by the relevant emission of the fuel used.
quantified in kilograms of co2.
scope 2 indirect energy utilization: annual energy consumption divided by the total annual revenue.
quantified in kilograms of co2.
scope 3 indirect energy utilization tenants : annual energy consumption tenants divided by the total annual rental income.
quantified in kilograms of co2.
business travel carbon emission flights : total carbon emissions of all valuemax passengers on business trips, based on the aircraft types and flight distances.
quantified in kilograms of co2.
valuemax climate metrics . the diagram shows a breakdown of valuemax's greenhouse gas emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3, categorized by source e.grams., purchased electricity, company vehicles, business travel, electricity usage of lease assets . the diagram includes the following greenhouse gases: co2, ch4, n2o, hfcs, pfcs, sf6, and nf3.
progress in developing a culture of sustainability valuemax recognizes the importance of building a culture of sustainability and encourages staff to actively adopt environmentally sustainable practices through the three 'r's of reduce, reuse, and recycle.
