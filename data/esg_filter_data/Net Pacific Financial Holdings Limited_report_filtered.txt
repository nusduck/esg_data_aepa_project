message from the president we will overcome turbulent times and create sustainable value by recognizing the importance of human resources that effect sustainability.
under the brand slogan, “passion in creating tomorrow,” pacific industrial group is promoting sustainability management under the long-term vision pacific glocal vision toward 2030, the 100th anniversary of our founding, and beyond.
under these circumstances, our group has worked to prevent infections, promoted cost improvements, built a production system to match order fluctuations, and secured personnel and parts.
in addition, we have formulated the pacific environmental challenge 2050 in light of social issues such as sdgs and carbon neutrality, and we are working to reduce co2 emissions.
in response to growing needs for lighter weight products, a new plant for stamping products is under construction adjacent to the higashi ogaki plant in ogaki city, gifu prefecture, with an eye toward carbon neutrality.
we are also focusing on developing control valves for heat-pump-type car air conditioners, which are expected to be increasingly used in electrified vehicles.
the elements of the material topics, including human rights, human resources, the environment, and responsible procurement, are incorporated into our group's "code of conduct" and "supplier sustainability guidelines.” we are implementing specific initiatives with our suppliers in japan and overseas, as well as promoting awareness through study sessions, the company newsletter, and e-mail magazine among other means.
as for "solving social and customer issues through products," we are working on cost reduction, weight reduction, and environmental impact reduction through lca using our product and material development, construction methods, and production technologies.
in recognition of these initiatives, we received 20 awards globally from our customers in fiscal 2021. as for new product development using existing technologies, following last year's release of “e-waves,” a multi-sensing logger for vaccine transportation and other applications, this june we launched "capsule sense,” a cow body condition monitoring system that contributes to solving the problems of cattle farmers who are suffering serious labor shortages.
with regard to the urgent issue of “mitigation of and adaptation to climate change,” in may of last year, we endorsed the tcfd recommendations and worked to refine our analysis of the risks and opportunities that climate change poses to our group while using scenario analysis techniques.
in particular, regarding the introduction of renewable energy, we are actively promoting the installation of solar power generation systems at our domestic and overseas plants using ppa, working to achieve 100% renewable energy in the kyushu and tohoku regions, and continuing our initiatives to achieve a 20% renewable energy ratio by 2030. there are no footnotes or additional annotations in the provided image.
more active roles for diverse human resources regarding "respecting human resources and their active participation," we are proceeding with human rights due diligence in accordance with our human rights policy, which was formulated in february of 2021. in addition, as part of our health initiatives, we were selected under the 2022 certified health & productivity management outstanding organizations recognition program large enterprise category . currently, we are establishing targets for the ratio of female managers and strengthening the recruitment of female employees to enable diverse human resources to play an active role.
in the future, we will accelerate diversity and inclusion management by creating an environment in which everyone can demonstrate their individual characteristics, not only women, but also foreign nationals and mid-career employees, in a variety of situations.
we will also promote education by rank and digital skill training to create an organization and culture in which diverse human resources can grow and create new value.

the company's response to the challenges of 2020 and the covid-19 pandemic involved solidifying its global foundations, prioritizing infection prevention, maintaining employment and production.
people-oriented management human resources are the most important management resource for a company, and fully utilizing their abilities is an indispensable condition for sustainable growth.
“respecting human resources and their active participation” is one of our material topics for sustainable management.
and pacific industrial considers what kind of human resources and organizational development we should aim for in the future.
we invited ms. taeko utsugi, who is known for her many achievements in women's softball, to speak with president ogawa based on her experience training players and building teams.
philosophy needed for human resource and organizational development ogawa: in ogaki city, gifu prefecture, there is the ogaki minamo softball club, operated by 11 local companies, which has been active since this year in the east division of the japan diamond softball league, a japanese women's softball league organization.
as such, i have been friends with ms. utsugi for some time and asked her to participate in this discussion.
utsugi: i started my athletic career 50 years ago at unitika in tarui.
i realized that manufacturing requires a sense of responsibility and accuracy in work, without accidents or mistakes, and that teamwork is the key to success.
ogawa: softball teams also have players with various personalities, don'tonnes they?
utsugi: first is a team philosophy.
at hitachi takasaki now bic camera takasaki , where i managed for the first time, the plant manager at the time told me about the company's philosophy and the purpose of establishing a softball team, and i set policies on what we would aim for and how we would overcome difficulties.
i made sure the company understood this, communicated my ideas to the players, listened to each player's ideas, and shaped the slogan and rules as the team philosophy.
a corporate sports team goes through good times president, member of the board, pacific industrial co., ltd.
building a place where diverse human resources can play an active role ogawa: in corporate management, utilization of diverse human resources, including the promotion of women's activities, is a major issue.
you became japan's first female softball team manager 36 years ago, and you also managed the all-japan team.
has the perception of female managers changed in the softball world?
when i first became a manager, i felt prejudice and heavy headwinds because i was a woman.
however, i didn'tonnes see any difference between men and women managers, and i had a strong desire to win and be the best.
i took the slander as proof of recognition that i was good, and i worked positively to succeed.
when i decided to become a manager, my father told me that a vice president and captain, japan women's softball league organization taeko utsugi profile born in 1953. she began playing softball in junior high school and joined unitika tarui in 1972 after graduating from high school.
she participated in the 1974 world championships.
she founded the npo softball dream in 2011. in 2021 she was appointed vice president and captain of the japan women's softball league organization.
she works to train young players and popularize the sport of softball, and has given numerous lectures and written a number of books.
this means being attentive to individual player's feelings and dealing with the relationships around them, including their families and the company, while maintaining an overall perspective and paying close attention to details, and then getting results.
thinking about things in this way, i have come to believe that it is important to know how to deal with each person's individuality and respect them as human beings, not based on attributes such as gender, age, race, nationality, or disability.
japan has always been a hierarchical society that emphasizes hard work.
however, once you go out into the world, lifestyles are different and japanese values and common sense do not apply.
our group also has many sites where women are active at our overseas offices.
laws have been enacted regarding the advancement of women, and employment of people with disabilities and the elderly, but simply following the law is insufficient.
we are also working toward a long-term goal of increasing the ratio of female managers.
to achieve this, we must work to ensure that our workplace environments and conditions are conducive to support systems that cater to life stages such as childbirth and childcare, and encourage career advancement while balancing work and family life.
whether in the corporate world or in sports, it is about understanding and respecting others and making it a place where all people can be active with their own thoughts and feelings.
asian women in particular tend to be reserved, but i would like them to show courage and confidence.
if we can bring out the best in each other in this way, we can create a more open world.
in the past, corporate management emphasized high efficiency through standardization and equalization, and tended to put people into molds.
but nowadays we live in time when people are expected to develop strengths, compensate for their weaknesses, and make the most of their individuality.
the covid-19 pandemic has made us a masked society and our communication skills have deteriorated.
rather than forcing young people to conform to old-fashioned thinking, we are working with the awareness that we are nurturing human resources in advance for the future.
this was made possible with the support of many people.
however, it is difficult to tell employees who have dreams to just realize them from nothing.
the internal environment needs to be the "watering grounds" that employees need, that is, the soil in which to take on challenges.
it is a system and structure that supports the challenges of employees who have dreams.
in addition to human rights due diligence, it is necessary to value awareness from daily communication.
we have introduced an evaluation system that requires not only competence in work, but also the “compassion” required to become a manager.
it is easier than before to generate proposals based on new ideas from within the company.
sustainability report 2022 sowing seeds for the future utsugi: i founded the non-profit organization softball dreams in 2011, with the initial objectives of our activities being to revive softball as an olympic sport, support players' second career activities, and to make various social contributions through softball.
as for social contributions, we are engaged in activities that contribute to the development of young people both in japan and overseas, mainly by holding softball classes for children to learn the joy of sports, which is something that also leads to human development and learning.
one of the most memorable initiatives was a visit to an african country.
we saw one child drinking muddy water and were worried, but when we warned him not to, he said, "i have to drink this to survive." i was shocked and it made me think about many things, including the huge differences between the lives of children there from those in japan.
when i visited the same place again 10 years later, to my surprise, the child i saw drinking the muddy water had grown up and become a softball coach.
they were still using the same bat as 10 years before and it was in bad shape, so they were happy when i gave them a new one.
we are also working to build sustainable relationships with all our stakeholders, from carbon neutrality to encouraging our suppliers to become more sustainable and contribute to local communities.
however, as you described, it is "planting seeds,” and it will take time for such efforts to bear fruit.
and i believe that our theme going forward is for each employee to work with an awareness of the relationship between themselves, the company, and society, and pass on to the next generation the future value that will be created through these relationships.
by doing so, we aspire to achieve sustainable growth as a company with a trusted reputation that meets the expectations of society.
an expression of this aspiration is our brand slogan.
in preparation for an upcoming mobility society, we will develop into a manufacturer capable of offering a prosperous, safe and secure future and help to realize a sustainable society.
toward this ambition, pacific industrial will create the future with passion.
we expressed the mental attitude that we want to cherish with the words “dreams and challenges” and "trust and respect,” with a focus on the company history and the ideas of our founder and predecessors, including the top management, as embodied in the founding spirit and the company motto.
our attitude principles of conduct to remain as a company needed by society, now and into the future through the development of new businesses, new technologies, and new products that contribute to improving safety, environment, and comfort performance, we aspire to achieve sustainable growth as a company with trusted reputation that meets the expectations of society.
based on the "principles of conduct”, the “code of conduct” clearly defines for our employees the concrete judgment standards by which they shall make appropriate decisions and properly conduct themselves.
we will work to consistently communicate with our customers and to provide environment-conscious, high-quality products and services that are trusted by, and satisfy, our customers.
from the perspective of respect for human rights and dignity, we will provide a workplace where all employees can work at ease in an environment that allows them to find work they can be proud of and encourages them to demonstrate their creativity and spirit of challenge.
we always recognize the importance of environmental conservation in all our business activities, comply with laws and regulations related to the environment, and actively engage in environmental conservation activities based on our "environmental policies." in addition to contributing to the sustainable development of society through close partnership and cooperation with local communities, we also engage in social contribution activities support for academics/culture/sports, participation in volunteer activities, international community contributions, etc. to build bonds with local communities.
under such circumstances, the pacific industrial group tackles the challenge of new value creation through manufacturing and clarifies the “aspired corporate image” as pacific glocal vision by reviewing its long-term vision in pursuit of contribution to a sustainable society.
aiming to be a 100-year company that continues to grow sustainably, and beyond, we are committed to taking on the challenge toward a new future.

ideal for managing physical condition: drinking water information enables more detailed physical condition management than ever before.
it can also capture minor changes that may have been missed in the past.
early detection and treatment of illnesses: fever from inflammatory reactions will not be missed, minimizing economic losses for farmers.
by maintaining proper tire pressure, tpms can prevent accidents, improve safety, and contribute to fuel efficiency.
in europe, america, and many other countries around the world, the use of these products is mandatory by law, and they contribute to society as our group’s primary products.
our products contribute to improved mobility and pedestrian safety many of our mainstay stamping products are used in vehicles that require particular strength and rigidity to ensure driver safety.
it has the function of softening the impact of pedestrians in the event of a car accident.
to reduce the impact on a pedestrian’s head in the event of an accident, we use friction stir welding fsw to change the thickness of the plate in one part, thus achieving both opposing performances of strength and softness.
development of environment-conscious products products for electrified vehicles demand for control valves for heat pump type automotive air conditioners is increasing.
against the backdrop of the severe impacts of climate change, the global mobility market is rapidly shifting toward electrified vehicles.
in particular, fcevs and bevs need to employ heat pump/air conditioners to reduce battery power consumption because they do not have a source of heat from the engine.
attention is focused on spu's support of the interior climate control standards committee of sae for over 20 years and the extensive capabilities and technical knowledge of the expansion valves developed and matured by pacific industrial.
wheel caps with weight reduction and improved aerodynamics our wheel caps have been used mainly for decorative purposes on steel wheels, but they are increasingly being used for aluminum wheels, including those for the prius.
by attaching wheel caps on top of lightweight designed aluminum wheels, both characteristics of "light weight" and "aerodynamic performance" streamlining air flowing on the sides of the vehicle are achieved, contributing to lower vehicle electricity costs.
in recognition of our track record in engines, our urethane parts have also been used to prevent noise from electric compressors used in car air-conditioning systems.
the radiated sound frequency band differs between engines and electric compressors, so we have developed new materials for electric compressors, resulting in a product with high sound insulation performance that meets the needs of our customers.
uhtss / cold stamping products in addition to contributing to reducing co2 emissions during driving by reducing the vehicle body weight with thinner and stronger stamping products for car body frames, we are actively promoting development and proposals for carbon neutrality based on lca . we are actively proposing replacing the hot stamping method, high co2 emissions during its production, with the cold stamping method using our accumulated knowhow and cutting-edge stamping technology.

minimizing environmental load disclosure of climate change-related information under the tcfd we recognize that climate change is one of the most important issues facing society, and we have declared that we will be carbon neutral by 2050, reduce co2 emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to fy2019, scope 1 or 2 , and are implementing group-wide initiatives to reduce co2 emissions.
we also endorsed the tcfd in may 2021, and are working strategically to understand the risks and opportunities of climate change.
in this report, we have organized our efforts to address climate change in line with the tcfd final recommendations.
governance the group has identified 15 material issues that are important for sustainability management, including “mitigation of and adaptation to climate change”, and categorized them into four themes.
the “mitigation of and adaptation to climate change” is led by the general manager of the safety and environment department, who works with the corporate planning department to set kpis and integrate them into business activities.
among the material topics, “mitigation of and adaptation to climate change” is recognized as the most important one.
in addition to reporting and deliberating on the status and making decisions at the sustainability promotion committee, attended by internal directors including the president, we discuss important issues individually at weekly corporate strategy committee meetings, held four times a year.
in addition, at least once a year, the board of directors deliberates on the status of sustainability activity reports and initiatives regarding risks and opportunities for climate change-related issues.
strategy our group’s risks and opportunities related to climate change were identified in line with the 1.5°c and 4°c scenarios, and the risks and opportunities recognized to date were refined.
strategies related to such risks and opportunities are developed mainly as “transition plans”, “adaptation measures”, and “development of environment-conscious products”.
energy prices are also expected to soar when carbon prices are factored in, with energy payments expected to increase by about 1 billion yen/year in 2030 and 2.6 billion yen/year in 2050. electricity, crude oil, natural gas , term: medium- and long term, level: high, countermeasure: follow the "pacific environmental challenge 2050" and work on the following: promote energy conservation; raise icp internal carbon pricing ; replace fossil fuel heavy oil, diesel oil, kerosene, natural gas facilities with electricity-saving facilities; understand and use next-generation energy green hydrogen and methanation trends.
introduction of renewable energy solar power generation systems ; purchase of co2-free electricity and renewable electricity certificates., strategy: 1 significant risks and opportunities: soaring raw material prices incl.
transition plan the group recognizes that the impacts of the climate change transition will be extremely significant, including carbon pricing and customer requests to reduce co₂ emissions.
in 2020, we formulated the pacific environmental challenge 2050, which aims to become carbon neutral in 2050, and we are promoting co₂ reduction throughout the group.
we have raised our 2030 target to 50% of the fiscal 2019 level scopes 1 and 2 , and are accelerating initiatives such as energy conservation, energy conversion, introduction of icp, and introduction of renewable energy.
our plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 2030 mid-term targets co₂ emissions: 50% reduction renewable energy ratio: 20% to achieve carbon neutrality virtually zero co₂ emissions in 2050 as set forth in pacific environmental challenge 2050, we have revised our mid-term target for 2030 to a 50% reduction compared to fiscal 2019 , and we will strengthen our efforts to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the entire life cycle.
water stress is also a concern., term: medium- and long term, impact level: medium, countermeasure: support for incorporation of measures against extreme weather into the bcp of high-risk suppliers; diversification of suppliers through local production risks: downstream, impact 1.5°c and 4°c scenario : major customers have requested cdp evaluations, reductions in co₂ emissions, and the like, and failure to respond to these requests could result in a loss of order opportunities.
exchange rate assumption: jpy120/united states dollar minimizing environmental load strategy 2: adaptation plan our group has production bases and supply chains around the world, and some regions may be affected by wind and flood damage due to the effects of extreme weather, high temperatures, etc., which will increase in the future.
strategy 3: development of environment-conscious products our group recognizes two major impacts of climate change as business opportunities.
one is the reduction of co2 emissions throughout the product life cycle.
our ultra-high tensile strength products our main products , lower co2 emissions during automobile use through weight reduction.
furthermore, the cold press method, which is our specialty, reduces co2 emissions during production to about one-eighth that of hot stamping method.
in addition to this, we are promoting the use of recycled materials and the manufacture of recyclable products.
of these, company-wide management-level risks are selected by the corporate strategy committee meetings, which discusses and deliberates on implementation measures.
we assess and manage significant risks across the organization, including those related to sustainability, such as climate change and social issues.
climate-related risks and opportunities are identified and evaluated by the tcfd.

respect for human rights human rights policy formulation in recent years, the importance of corporate efforts to address human rights issues as a social requirement is growing.
we consider human rights to be a core issue for sustainability management and created the “pacific industrial group human rights policy” in february 2021. under this policy, all employees will act with high ethical standards and integrity as sensible members of the global community, and the entire group will work together to promote initiatives that respect human rights.
implementation of human rights surveys through human rights due diligence mechanisms, our group strives to identify and either prevent or mitigate negative impacts on human rights.
these mechanisms include the regular monitoring of the implementation status of our “code of conduct” and “supplier sustainability guidelines”.
based on the results of a questionnaire conducted in fiscal 2020 for our group in japan, including our company, in accordance with the code of conduct, we conducted a questionnaire survey in fiscal 2021 with a strengthened section on harassment, and worked to resolve problematic harassment cases.
education engagement upon the development of our “human rights policy”, in order to raise awareness of human rights within the group and to put into practice the creation of a corporate culture of respect for human rights, we conduct awareness-raising and educational activities to promote proper understanding of those rights and ensure that information is shared throughout the company.
specifically, we will incorporate human rights education into stratified education programs, create a foreign language version of the policy and ensure that it is thoroughly disseminated to overseas business subsidiaries, and expand it to related business partners.
we hold study sessions and opinion exchange meetings by human rights lawyers and ngos to promote human rights due diligence.
we also created a special feature article on human rights in the company newsletter distributed to all employees to promote understanding of the importance of human rights.
stable employment and decent work environment improving employee engagement we believe that the key to continued value creation is the ease and satisfaction employees feel when fulfilling their roles.
we therefore analyze the results of various surveys conducted within our company so that we can better understand the progress and challenges of efforts to improve employee awareness and satisfaction, and share issues with management and other employees in order to create a company and workplace that is cheerful and rewarding to work at while simultaneously exploring and implementing other measures to improve engagement.
decent work environment creating a decent work environment will improve employee job satisfaction and engagement with the company, which will lead to a higher retention rate.
we are actively working to improve the working environment in our offices and plants and to review various systems.
flexible working styles, such as promoting the taking of annual paid leave, reducing long working hours of training per employee, changing some working hours of training per employee, shortening working hours of training per employee, staggered working hours of training per employee, and flextime systems to support both childcare and nursing care is also introduced.
in addition, since good human relationships are important for a decent work environment, we have a workplace senior system that assigns younger senior employees to new employees, pre-training for managers and supervisors at the company to which they are assigned, and regular interviews.
we are developing human resources while confirming the physical and mental health of each employee.
we also hold regular informal gatherings where management and employees can freely talk about their thoughts and feelings about their work, as well as any problems they face, and strive to create an open workplace.
converting non-regular employees into regular employees we regularly evaluate non-permanent temporary and contract employees and make them permanent employees if they have the qualifications.
in fiscal 2021, we hired 30 full-time employees company-wide.
work-life balance we are implementing a variety of measures to ensure that employees are able to feel satisfaction and personal growth at work, while living a fulfilling personal life.
in addition to being awarded “kurumin” certification as a company that supports childcare, we have set a target of having employees take 12 days of annual paid vacation and have been working to ensure that target is achieved.
in april 2019, we introduced a work-interval system to guarantee the minimum hours of training per employee away from work before coming in for the next day.
efforts are made to ensure adequate rest time between daily workdays.
we will remain committed to supporting our employees to maintain a balance between work and their personal commitments including childcare and nursing care, while fostering a work environment and corporate culture that encourages employees to use vacation time, maintain their health, and work vigorously.
the safety and health of employees building a safe and secure workplace based on the principle of safety first, in accordance with the occupational health and safety management system, we promote safety management initiatives centered on human resource development, equipment safety measures, and workplace development to provide a healthy, safe, and secure workplace for employees.
in addition, a health and safety committee has been established to investigate and deliberate on basic measures to prevent worker hazards and health problems, and labor and management work together to address these issues.
health and safety risks are assessed at each workplace and prioritized to promote activities to reduce risks.
human resource development in order to become a company that is strict about safety, we use the safety-dojo, facilities for safety education, in the study hall as a base for technical education.
we also conduct safety experience education, risk assessment education, and hazard prediction training for employees at each level to improve their ability to recognize danger as part of our efforts to increase risk sensitivity.
we provide the same training for temporary employees as we do for regular employees to help improve their sensitivity to hazards.
in safety activities with our suppliers, we hold safety study sessions to mutually improve the level of safety, and we also conduct safety training using our safety dojos.
we are also promoting the establishment and expansion of safety dojos to provide extensive safety education even at remote plants.
equipment safety measures focus items for the eradication of stop6, which are the six key factors to prevent serious accidents, are incorporated into our daily activities, and we are working to establish and continue implementing those activities, clarify priorities, and promote countermeasures.
we aim to create a safe workplace through risk eradication at the process and equipment design stage, and work risk assessments at the installation stage, for the safety of new equipment and lines.
providing proper work environments we are working toward providing decent work environments by introducing air-conditioned clothing and systematically making progress on converting plant lighting to leds.
health management initiatives from 2005, we began efforts to promote work-life balance.
in 2006, we became the first company to be registered as a “hatsu ratsu workplace creation declaration” by the gifu labor bureau, and since then we have been promoting the mental and physical health of our employees in a concrete and continuous manner.
in recent years, with the declining birthrate, aging population, and health consciousness, the importance of health management is increasing.
we are also placing importance on the health of our employees as the foundation for the success of our human resources.
in september 2021, we stipulated our stance on this matter in the "pacific industrial group health declaration.” we are continuously working on health management.
in march 2022, in recognition of our health management efforts, we were recognized in “2022 certified health & productivity management outstanding organizations recognition program large corporation category ” jointly sponsored by the ministry of economy, trade and industry and the japan health council.
we will continue to engage in health activities that are tailored to each employee and in measures that improve the physical and mental health of employees and their families.
<pacific industrial group health declaration we consider the health and safety of our employees to be the starting point of "monozukuri", and we will work to maintain and improve the physical and mental health of our employees and their families, and create a comfortable work environment for the sustainable growth of the company and our employees.
in order to achieve our brand slogan, "passion in creating tomorrow," we declare that we value new ideas and challenges, and that we will strive to create a company where people can feel a sense of harmony between work and life, and work in a healthy and vigorous manner.
development of human resources and cultivation of culture that we can tackle new endeavors basic approach and policy for human resources education with the intent to achieve our management strategy, and with an eye on the medium to long-term human resource development issues of raising up the baseline of the new generation of workers and the early development of leaders, we believe that the key to human resource development is "where ability meets compassion".
therefore, in addition to providing education to improve skill, we also provide well-balanced, well-timed education opportunities to acquire both ability and compassion.
strengthen education at each level in april 2021, we conducted a complete review of our new education program and restructured it into an effective education system that nurtures people.
for our staff, we have expanded training for management and supervisory positions, introduced problem solving for new employees, for technical staff, toyota production system tps practical leader education, training systematized on safety, quality, productivity and improve humanity that newly incorporated.
in fy2022, we plan to expand the content of our existing harassment education by adding new education to improve psychological safety, and to create a safer and more productive workplace where employees can work safely and with peace of mind.
diversity and inclusion policies and initiatives we believe that by creating a work environment and corporate culture that is inclusive and allows employees to demonstrate their abilities in accordance with their internal attributes, including their individuality, strengths and weaknesses, health conditions, personality, beliefs, and sexual orientation, we can revitalize workplaces, contribute to innovation, and reduce employee turnover rate.
promotion of women's activities we believe that the further advancement of women is essential for the sustainable growth of a company and the strengthening of corporate competitiveness.
regarding the percentage of female staff hires, we are working to increase the percentage of female hires each year to at least 20% strengthened from 10% , and the percentage of female hires scheduled to join the company in 2023 is 26% as of september 2022 . in addition, we support male employees taking childcare leave based on the belief that male employees' participation in childcare is necessary to promote women's success.

all of these products were developed to solve social issues by applying the technologies cultivated in the automobile-related field to other fields, and were created because employees are “aware of the relationship between themselves, the company, and society.” there are several other products under development to solve social issues, clearly demonstrating that each employee is “aware of the relationship between themselves, the company, and society” and are actively involved in the development of new products outside of the mainstay automotive field.
i felt that the commitment of each and every employee who promotes these initiatives is reflected in the real work to achieve sustainability.
in the same way, why not communicate in the future as to how each employee feels about the initiatives for other material topics as well?
three years have passed since moving from a csr report to a sustainability report.
in addition, by conveying the thoughts of employees who are promoting the initiatives in the sustainability report, i believe sympathy and support can be gathered from stakeholders.
a think tank of ogaki kyoritsu bank, okb research institute works with the bank to conduct surveys and research on the industrial and economic trends, lifestyles and cultures of the community, with the goal of promoting local industries, developing companies, and improving the livelihoods and cultures of local residents.
our group is committed to becoming carbon neutrality by 2050, and in addition to promoting decarbonization initiatives throughout the supply chain, we are focusing on the development of products for electrified vehicles, including lightweight, sound and vibration insulation, and thermal management products, in anticipation of an electrified mobility society.
in addition to the mobility field, the company is also taking on challenges in new fields, such as the development of capsule sense, which applies core technologies to solve issues faced by livestock farmers, and we are working to solve social issues through business.
going forward, human resources that can take on these various challenges with passion will be of utmost importance.
we will continue to create opportunities for diverse human resources to play an active role and promote sustainability management with the aim of becoming a company that can “create value,” and that is trusted and needed by society.
