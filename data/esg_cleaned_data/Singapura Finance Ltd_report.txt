image description: singapura finance logo chairman's statement on behalf of the board of directors, i am pleased to present the annual report and financial statements of the group and the company for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 “fy2022” . performance review the external operating environment for fy2022 continued to be challenging even as covid-19 eases.
cost of funds have increased due to interest rate hikes to curb inflation.
under this difficult business environment, the group recorded a profit after tax of $8.3 million, a decline of 13.2% compared to last year.
the weaker performance was primarily due to higher operating expenses and impairment allowances on loans.
net interest income and hiring charges improved by 6.6% to $26.2 million compared to $24.6 million last year.
total interest income rose by $4.5m or 15.0% mainly attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, singapore government securities "sgs" and other interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment.
correspondingly, total interest expense increased sharply by $2.8m or 56.3% during the year.
non-interest income declined by $0.6 million or 42.1% mainly due to the curtailment of the government covid-19 grants.
total operating expenses increased by 17.0% or $2.2 million compared to last year as the group continued to forge ahead with our digital transformation.
there was a net charge for loan impairment losses amounting to $1.4 million for the year ended 31 december 2022 compared to $1.2 million for year ended 31 december 2021. the group continues to set aside adequate specific and collective allowances in respect of its loan portfolio.
the group's shareholders' funds remain robust at $252 million as at 31 december 2022, and is more than adequate to buffer further volatility in the current economic slowdown.
our capital adequacy ratio continues to be well above the regulatory minimum requirement.
fair value reserve for the year ended 31 december 2022 declined by $6.2 million due to decrease in the fair value of the sgs.
the group purchases sgs for the purposes of maintaining minimum liquid assets as required under the finance companies act.
the group's total loan, net of allowances, dipped by 5.7% to $844 million as at 31 december 2022 compared to $896 million as at 31 december 2021. in line with the lower loan balance, total customers' deposits were managed downwards by 1.6% to $894 million as at 31 december 2022 compared to $908 million as at 31 december 2021. in the opinion of the directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the group and the company in the interval between the end of the financial period and the date of this report.
the group is mindful of the challenges ahead and will be proactive in managing our net interest margin in the environment of rising interest rates and continues its aim to stay relevant and competitive as we continue to forge ahead with our digital transformation to sustain the group's long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
chairman's statement dividends subject to approval of shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting, the board is recommending a first and final one-tier tax exempt dividend of 2.0 singapore cents per share and a special one-tier tax exempt dividend of 1.25 singapore cents per share for fy2022.
the total distribution of 3.25 singapore cents per share for the year will amount to approximately $5.16 million.
operations review 2022 was a defining year for the group.
we launched our mobile application and web-based online services sfl go for retail customers and sfl ibiz for corporate customers by october 2022. the launch is a key enabler for our group to better serve our customers, to remain relevant and connect to the younger and tech-savvy customers and to catch up with the competition, especially with the new digital banks.
even as covid-19 eases, the group will continue to forge ahead with our digital transformation initiatives to improve and streamline our work processes.
the group remains committed to drive the digitalization of customer touch points without compromising the security of transactions.
our journey to implement digital touch points adopts a security by design and zero-trust strategies.
we continue to be vigilant and bolster our monitoring of cyber-related security risks.
the group is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and is actively playing our part to reduce our carbon footprint.
in our support to align its corporate philosophy, strategy and goals to the government's vision of green finance, the group has in place a framework for its environmental risk management in a manner that commensurate with the group's size.
the underlying structure of the framework recognizes that environmental risk poses potential financial and reputational impact to the company.
outlook looking ahead to 2023, gdp growth rates in most major economies are expected to moderate from 2022 levels, with sharp slowdowns projected in the us and eurozone.
meanwhile, global supply disruptions are likely to continue into 2023 as the war in ukraine drags on, even though the extent and frequency of disruptions is expected to ease.
in the us, gdp growth is projected to slow significantly, as tighter financial conditions, a reduction in household savings, and negative household wealth effects arising from asset market corrections are expected to weigh on private consumption.
similarly, gdp growth in the eurozone is forecast to slow sharply.
in particular, higher cost pressures arising from significant energy disruptions due to the russia-ukraine war, alongside tighter financial conditions, are likely to dampen consumption and industrial production.
at the same time, significant uncertainties and downside risks in the global economy remain.
first, with many advanced economies raising interest rates simultaneously to combat high inflation, the impact of tightening financial conditions on global growth could be larger than expected.
second, financial stability risks could intensify if there are disorderly market adjustments to monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies.
a sharp repricing of assets could trigger capital outflows from the region and increase debt servicing burdens, thereby dampening regional economies' growth outlook.
third, further escalations in the war in ukraine and geopolitical tensions among major global powers could worsen supply disruptions, dampen consumer and business confidence, as well as weigh on global trade.
amid these global uncertainties and headwinds, the ministry of trade and industry "mti" forecast singapore's economic growth to slow to 0.5% to 2.5% in 2023, moderating from growth of 3.6% and 8.9% in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
the group is mindful of the challenges ahead and will be proactive in managing our net interest margin in the environment of rising interest rates and continue to manage our risk exposures closely.
the group continues its aim to stay relevant and competitive as we continue to forge ahead with our digital transformation to sustain the group's long-term growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

net interest income rose by $1.6m or 6.6% for the financial year ended 31 december 2022 compared to the same period last year mainly due to higher yield from interest-earning assets.
total interest income rose by $4.5m or 15.0% mainly attributed to the increase in interest income from loans and advances, singapore government securities and other interest earning assets amidst a higher interest rate environment.
correspondingly, total interest expense increased sharply by $2.8m or 56.3% as our average cost of funds spiked from 0.55% to 0.90% during the year.
as the rate of increase in assets yield is higher than that of cost of funds, the group's net interest margin as a percentage of the interest-earning assets improved from 2.16% to 2.35%. financial review the table below shows the change in the net interest income in 2022 over 2021 due to the impact of volume and changes in rates.

to do so, we have implemented policies and procedures to manage our energy use such as educating our employees and engaging them in matters concerning energy consumption.
as part of our “go green” initiative, we have communicated green information periodically using both formal and informal communication tools to encourage our employees to be more energy efficient.
for example, we remind our employees to increase the temperature on air-conditioners where possible and to switch off it devices and air-conditioners when they are not in use.
sfl monitors our electricity bills diligently to identify and address any abnormal usage as well as rectify any equipment malfunctioning.
since fy2019, recycling bins have been installed in our office and we continue to encourage our employees to adopt better recycling habits.
electricity usage is our main source of energy consumption.
in fy2022, sfl achieved our target of maintaining the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
additionally, in fy2022, we converted all lightings in head office and all customer centres to led lighting.
sfl's annual electricity consumption decreased by 11.6% from fy2021 to fy2022, with a 19% decrease from fy2017 figure 1a . energy intensity per employee also reduced by more than 10% from fy2021 to fy2022 with an overall decrease from fy2017 to fy2022 by 17% figure 1b . in fy2023, our energy target is not to exceed the previous year's energy consumption by more than 2%.

we continue to encourage the reduction of water consumption for all employees by reminding employees in customer centres to use water conservatively at all times.
going forward, sfl will continue to assess initiatives to reduce water consumption and aim to maintain current consumption levels as per previous years.
social employment gri 2-7, gri 401-1 i recruitment we continue to embrace the tripartite guidelines on fair employment practices in recruiting talents regardless of their gender, race, religion, cultural and family background.
for example, sfl values the experience of the older generation and supports them to re-join the workforce.
where eligible, sfl extends re-employment opportunities to eligible staff upon their retirement.
sfl recruits potential employees through a vast range of channels such as collaborating with professional recruitment consultants, leveraging on internet recruitment platforms and encouraging staff referrals.
in fy2022, we've maintained online interviews to suit current hybrid working models.

singapura finance ltd annual report 2022 corporate sustainability reporting ii employment practices we have set in place various schemes such as cross-training and inter-departmental transfers to enhance the diversity of employees' job scope where possible.
this practice provides employees with new learning opportunities and cultivates expertise.
this platform also encourages meetings between colleagues from different departments, which helps bridge inter-departmental understanding and synergies.
this will help improve camaraderie and collaborative culture within sfl.
furthermore, conversing with colleagues from other departments can inspire more creative solutions as they are able to offer fresh perspectives.
we also adopt an open appraisal system for our employees to set goals and receive feedback.

independent auditors' report key audit matters continued allowance for expected credit losses amounting to $6,950,000 2021: $5,677,000 refer to note 6 to the financial statements the key audit matter: allowance for ecl is viewed as a key audit matter due to the significance of loans and advances to customers and the inherent complexity of the group’s ecl model.
the group’s loans and advances to customers represent 72% of its total assets.
loss allowances are measured based on: 12-month ecls for financial assets where credit risk hasn'tonnes significantly increased since initial recognition, or if there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk "stage 1 ecls" . lifetime ecls for financial assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition "stage 2 ecls" or are credit impaired "stage 3 ecls" . judgment is required in the following areas: appropriateness of the methodology and parameters used in the ecl model.
identification of credit exposures exhibiting a "significant increase in credit risk".
determination of relevant macroeconomic factors for incorporation into the model.
in 2022, the group refreshed its ecl model by further segmenting its loan portfolio into more granular portfolio profiles.
due to the uncertain economic outlook, the group exercised judgment in assessing the reasonableness and validity of post-model adjustments, including economic scenarios, to address possible model limitations.
how the matter was addressed in our audit: we tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of key controls in place over the credit approval and review processes.
we performed sample checks of credit reviews on loans and advances to critically assess the appropriateness of credit grading and any objective evidence of impairment.
we considered the appropriateness of management's criteria for identifying significant increases in credit risk, considering the impacts of the economic outlook.
for credit-impaired exposures, we assessed the reasonableness of management's estimates of expected future cash flows, including the realizable value of collaterals if relevant . for non-credit-impaired exposures, we reviewed the appropriateness of the ecl methodology and management's assumptions on the parameters used in the ecl model including loan portfolio segmentation, probability of default term structure, loss given default, exposure at default, and macroeconomic factors . we tested the accuracy of key data inputs into the ecl models for a sample of exposures at year-end by checking them against source systems and documents.
we independently recalculated the ecl allowance for a sample of credit exposures to test the mathematical accuracy of calculations produced by the ecl model.
in response to the uncertain economic outlook, we assessed the reasonableness of post-model adjustments applied by management and considered the adequacy of disclosures of key assumptions in the financial statements.
based on our procedures, the methodology, assumptions, and data adopted by management in the ecl model were considered acceptable, and the ecl computation was consistent with the ecl model.

auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ssas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with ssas, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
we also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal controls.

our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report.
however, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 these notes form an integral part of the financial statements.
the financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 24 february 2023. 1 domicile and activities singapura finance ltd 'the company' is incorporated in the republic of singapore and has its registered office at 150 cecil street, 01-00, singapore 069543. the principal activities of the company are those relating to finance companies operating under the finance companies act 1967. the principal activities of the subsidiaries are set out in note 9 to the financial statements.
the financial statements of the company as at the end of the year ended 31 december 2022 comprise the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'group' and individually as 'group entities' . 2 basis of preparation 2.1 statement of compliance the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with singapore financial reporting standards international 'sfrs i ' . 2.2 basis of measurement the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities which are measured at fair values.
2.3 functional and presentation currency these financial statements are presented in singapore dollars, which is the group's functional currency.
all financial information presented in singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
2.4 use of estimates and judgements the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with sfrs i requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
actual results may differ from these estimates.
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is included in note 3.4 impairment.
2.4 use of estimates and judgements continued uncertain economic environment the uncertain economic environment has increased the estimation uncertainty in developing significant accounting estimates, predominantly related to expected credit losses and its related post-model adjustments.
the estimation uncertainty is associated with: the extent and duration of the expected economic downturn and forecasts for key economic factors including gross domestic product ‘gdp’ ; the extent and duration of the disruption to business arising from the expected economic downturn; and the effectiveness of government and central bank measures that have and will be put in place to support businesses and consumers through this disruption and economic downturn.
the company has developed accounting estimates based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions as at 31 december 2022 about future events that management believes are reasonable in the circumstances.
there is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing forecasts.
the underlying assumptions are also subject to uncertainties which are often outside the control of the company.
accordingly, actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of those differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in these financial statements.
the impact of the uncertain economic environment on expected credit losses is discussed further in note 23. 2.5 changes in accounting policies new standards and amendments the group has applied the following sfrs i s, amendments to and interpretations of sfrs i for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 january 2022: covid-19-related rent concessions beyond 30 june 2021 amendments to sfrs i 16 reference to the conceptual framework amendments to sfrs i 3 property, plant and equipment: proceeds before intended use amendments to sfrs i 1-16 onerous contracts – cost of fulfilling a contract amendments to sfrs i 1-37 annual improvements to sfrs i standards 2018-2020 the application of these amendments to standards and interpretations does not have a material effect on the financial statements.
3 significant accounting policies the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, which addresses changes in accounting policies.
3.1 basis of consolidation i subsidiaries subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
the group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the group.
ii transactions eliminated on consolidation intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
iii loss of control when the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity.
any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
iv accounting for subsidiaries investments in subsidiaries are stated in the company's balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
3.2 property, plant and equipment i recognition and measurement items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
the cost of self-constructed assets includes: the cost of materials and direct labour; any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use; when the group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and capitalised borrowing costs.
purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
if significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items major components of property, plant and equipment.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.2 property, plant and equipment continued i recognition and measurement continued any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item is recognised in profit or loss.
ii subsequent costs the cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the group, and its cost can be measured reliably.
the carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised.
the costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.
iii depreciation depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.
significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.
depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.
freehold land is not depreciated.
depreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.
the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows: freehold land and buildings - 40 years leasehold land and buildings - lease period or useful lives, whichever is shorter furniture and office equipment - between 5 and 8 years motor vehicles - 4 years computers - between 3 and 5 years depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.
3.3 financial instruments i recognition and initial measurement non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities the group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits when they are originated.
all other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
a financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss “fvtpl” , transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
transaction costs of financial assets carried at fvtpl are expensed in profit or loss.
. there are no footnotes or annotations in the provided image.
3.3 financial instruments continued ii classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses non-derivative financial assets classification on initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci – debt investments; fvoci – equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss fvtpl . financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.
financial assets at amortised cost a financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl: it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
debt investments at fvoci a debt investment is measured at fvoci if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fvtpl: it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
equity investments at fvoci on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading, the company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in oci.
this election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.
financial assets at fvtpl all financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or fvoci as described above are measured at fvtpl.
on initial recognition, the group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at fvoci as at fvtpl if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.3 financial instruments continued ii classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses continued business model assessment the group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.
the information considered includes: the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.
these include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the group's management; the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model and how those risks are managed; how managers of the business are compensated – e.grams. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.
transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the group's continuing recognition of the assets.
financial assets that are held-for-trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at fvtpl.
assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest for the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.
‘interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs e.grams. liquidity risk and administrative costs , as well as a profit margin.
in assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.
this includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.
in making this assessment, the group considers: contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features; prepayment and extension features; and terms that limit the group's claim to cash flows from specified assets e.grams. non-recourse features . there are no footnotes or additional annotations in the provided image.
3. significant accounting policies continued 3.3 financial instruments continued ii classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses continued assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest continued a prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract.
additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued but unpaid contractual interest which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.
subsequent measurement and gains and losses financial assets at amortised cost these assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
the amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses.
interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
debt investments at fvoci these assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss.
other net gains and losses are recognised in oci.
on derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in oci are reclassified to profit or loss.
equity investments at fvoci these assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.
other net gains and losses are recognised in oci and are never reclassified to profit or loss.
financial assets at fvtpl these assets are subsequently measured at fair value.
net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.
non-derivative financial liabilities classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
they are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.3 financial instruments continued iii derecognition financial assets the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.
any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
financial liabilities the group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.
the group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.
on derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed is recognised in profit or loss.
iv modifications of financial assets if the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.
if the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired.
in this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.
any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows: fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.
if cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms.
if the group plans to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place.
this approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.
if the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or fvoci does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.
for floating-rate financial assets, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification.
any costs or fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.
if such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses.
in other cases, it is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.
3.3 financial instruments continued v offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
vi share capital ordinary shares are classified as equity.
incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
3.4 impairment i non-derivative financial assets the group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses 'ecls' on: financial assets measured at amortised costs; and debt investments measured at fvoci.
loss allowances of the group are measured on either of the following bases: 12-month ecls : these are ecls that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months ; or lifetime ecls : these are ecls that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
general approach the group applies the general approach to provide for ecls on all other financial instruments.
under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ecls at initial recognition.
at each reporting date, the group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.
when credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ecls.
when determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ecls, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.
this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.
if credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ecls.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.4 impairment continued i non-derivative financial assets continued general approach continued the group considers a financial asset to be in default when: the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held ; or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.
the group considers a financial guarantee to be in default when the debtor of the loan is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the creditor and the group in full, without recourse by the group to actions such as realising security if any is held . the group only applies a discount rate if, and to the extent that, the risks are not taken into account by adjusting the expected cash shortfalls.
the group considers singapore government securities and bank deposits to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to “investment grade” assigned by internationally recognised external credit rating agencies.
the maximum period considered when estimating ecls is the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk.
measurement of ecls ecls are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses.
credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the group expects to receive . ecls are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.
credit-impaired financial assets at each reporting date, the group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at fvoci are credit-impaired.
a financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the borrower; a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due; the restructuring of a loan or advance by the group on terms that the group would not consider otherwise; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

3.4 impairment continued i non-derivative financial assets continued presentation of allowance for ecls in the statement of financial position loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.
for debt investments at fvoci, loss allowances are charged to profit or loss and recognised in oci.
loss allowances for financial guarantee are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the financial guarantee less the cumulated income recognised.
write-off the gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off either partially or in full to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
this is generally the case when the group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off.
however, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
ii non-financial assets the carrying amounts of the group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
if any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
for goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit ‘cgu’ exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu.
for the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cgus.
impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cgu group of cgus , and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cgu group of cgus on a pro rata basis.
an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
in respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
3.5 employee benefits defined contribution plans a defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees.

notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 3 significant accounting policies continued 3.5 employee benefits continued other long-term employee benefits the group's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than defined contribution plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
that benefit is accrued annually at a specified rate based on salaries paid to employees during the period.
benefits are only applicable to employees who joined before 28 december 2002 and completed 12 years of continuous service.
short-term benefits short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
3.6 provisions a provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
the unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
3.7 interest interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortised cost of the financial liability.
the effective interest rate is established on initial recognition of the financial assets and is not revised subsequently unless contractually adjusted.
the calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
interest income and expense presented in the income statement include interest on financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost on an effective interest rate basis.
where charges are added to the principal financed at the commencement of the period, the general principle adopted for crediting income to profit or loss is to spread the income over the period in which the repayments are due using the following bases for the various categories of financing business: interest income on loans and advances in general, the basis adopted for crediting income from loans to profit or loss is to spread the interest over the period in which the repayments are due.
interest on mortgage loans is charged on the annual/monthly/daily rest basis and credited to profit or loss in the period to which it relates.
interest rebate on hire purchase term charges on hire purchase and leasing transactions are accounted for using the rule of 78 sum of digits method.
the balance of such term charges at the financial year end is carried forward as unearned charges.

3 significant accounting policies continued 3.7 interest continued interest income from singapore government securities is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.
interest income from bank deposits is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues using the effective interest method.
3.8 dividend income dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the shareholder's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.
3.9 government grants government grants that compensate the group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss as ‘other income’ on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the condition for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised.
in this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.
3.10 tax tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
the group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under sfrs i 1-37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
the amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.
current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.
current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the measurement of deferred taxes reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.
3.10 tax continued deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.
unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
3.11 leases at inception of a contract, the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
as a lessee at commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices.
the group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
the right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
the right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the group will exercise a purchase option.
in that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment.
in addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.
generally, the group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
the group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.
3.11 leases continued as a lessee continued lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and the exercise price under a purchase option that the group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.
the lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
it is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option, or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.
when the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
the group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'trade and other payables' in the balance sheet.
short term leases and leases of low-value assets the group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including it equipment.
the company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3.12 earnings per share the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares.
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

extension options some property leases contain extension options exercisable by the company up to one year before the end of the non-cancellable contract period.
where practicable, the company seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility.
the extension options held are exercisable only by the company and not by the lessors.
the company assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.
the company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.
the company has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $1,239,000 2021: $1,003,000 . notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management overview the group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk this note presents information about the group's exposure to each of the above risks, the group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the group's management of capital.
risk management framework the board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group's risk management framework.
the board has established the risk management committee ‘rmc’ , which is responsible for developing and monitoring the group's risk management policies.
the rmc reports regularly to the board of directors on its activities.
the group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risk and adherence to limits.
risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the group's activities.
all major policy decisions and approval on risk exposures including loan limits are approved by the board of directors upon concurrence by the rmc.
in addition, internal audits are conducted on an on-going basis to confirm that these policies and procedures are functioning effectively and any deviations are duly highlighted for special attention.
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's loans and advances to customers.
for risk management reporting purposes, the group considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure.
management of credit risk the board of directors has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to the rmc, which in turn appoints the credit control committee and credit portfolio committee to assist in the management of credit risk.
the credit control committee develops the credit risk management framework, policies and procedures for review and concurrence by rmc and approval by the board of directors.
the credit control committee also reviews delinquent accounts and makes decisions on recovery actions.
credit reviews are conducted regularly to monitor the health of the loan portfolio and to detect early signs of weaknesses and deviations.
the credit portfolio committee manages risk on a portfolio-wide basis and recommends alternative portfolio strategies, analyses results of portfolio management actions, and develops portfolio limits for each portfolio segment for approval by the rmc.
credit risk concentration is addressed by setting a credit portfolio mix limit and monitoring the limit on a regular basis.
the credit portfolio committee periodically reviews the lending authority framework, portfolio concentration limits and credit stress test framework.
credit stress tests are also conducted periodically to determine the impact of security values and other stress parameters on the loan portfolio.
this allows the group to assess the potential financial impact of losses arising from plausible adverse scenarios on the group's loan portfolio.
financial risk management continued credit risk continued management of credit risk the sfrs i 9 committee “sc” works closely with the credit portfolio committee and credit control committee to ensure that the group has appropriate credit risk practices, including an effective system of internal control, to consistently determine adequate allowances in accordance with the group’s policies and procedures relating to impairment allowances and applicable accounting framework under sfrs i 9. the sc also reviews and recommends updates to the governance & control framework of ecl model as well as the impairment allowance policy.
any material changes to the ecl framework, methodology and policies are reviewed by sc before recommendation to the audit committee for concurrence and approval.
inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment assessment of significant increase in credit risk when determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.
this includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the group’s historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-looking information.
the group considers significant increase in credit risk occurs when an asset is more than 30 days past due.
modified financial assets the contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer.
an existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 3.3 iv . for loans subjected to the covid-19 repayment deferral arrangements, an assessment of significant increase in credit risk has been determined based on various measures of the customer’s current financial position and earnings capacity from which the loans are categorised into risk categories – low, medium and high.
significant increase in credit risk is then determined based on the resulting risk categorisation.
customers who have requested a deferral extension and are categorised as high risk are classified as having a significant increase in credit risk.
calculation of expected credit losses expected credit losses are calculated using three main components: probability of default “pd” ; loss given default “lgd” ; and exposure at default “ead” . these components are generally derived from internally developed statistical models using historical, current and forward-looking macro-economic data such as gdp, unemployment and inflation.
these factors were updated in the current year, reflecting the actual and expected impact of the uncertain economic environment.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management continued credit risk continued inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment continued calculation of expected credit losses continued probability of default the 12-month and lifetime pd represent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining lifetime of the financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and future economic conditions that affect credit risk.
the pd is derived using delinquency roll rate model which incorporates historical default rates over past years, adjusted for forward-looking information and reflecting current portfolio composition and market data such as gdp, unemployment and inflation.
loss given default lgd represents expected loss conditional on default, taking into account the mitigating effect of collateral, its expected value when realised and the time value of money.
exposure at default ead represents the expected exposure in the event of a default.
the group derives the ead from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation.
for lending commitments, the eads are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations.
the 12-month ecl is equal to the discounted sum over the next 12 months of monthly pd multiplied by lgd and ead.
lifetime ecl is calculated using the discounted sum of monthly pd over the full remaining life multiplied by lgd and ead.
post-model adjustments post-model adjustments ‘pmas’ are short-term adjustments to the ecl balance as part of the year-end reporting process to reflect possible model limitations.
the pmas are sensitive to judgments and assumptions made regarding formulation of forward-looking scenarios and how such scenarios are incorporated in the calculations.
the group has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of pmas.
the aim of the group is to incorporate these pmas into the ecl models, where possible, as part of the periodic recalibration and model assessment procedures.
the group has incorporated pmas based on the forecasted gdp growth to capture possible limitations arising from the uncertain economic environment.
the above pma as at 31 december 2022 increased the loss allowance by $1.6 million 2021: $0.9 million . 106 financial risk management continued credit risk continued inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment continued exposure to credit risk the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets in the statements of financial position, reduced by the value of the collateral held.

there are no loans and advances with renegotiated terms that are neither past due nor impaired as at 31 december 2022 2021: $nil . past due but not impaired: when contractual interest or principal payments are past due by not more than three months and the group believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of the security available and/or the stage of collection.
write off: the group writes off wholly or partially loan balances together with any related allowances for impairment losses when the group determines that the debts are irrecoverable, e.grams. borrower has been made bankrupt, or all actions have been exhausted.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management continued credit risk continued inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment continued exposure to credit risk continued repayment deferral: since march 2020, the group has offered various forms of assistance to customers to counteract the impact of covid-19 on the ability of customers to meet their loan obligations.
the assistance provided has included arrangements such as temporary deferral of principal and interest repayments, and extension of loan maturity dates.
the loan repayment deferral is considered to be a loan modification non-substantial modification whereby the existing loan continues to be recognised.
the table below shows the gross carrying amount of loans that have been modified during the year: table: loan modification summary : interest servicing only, 2022 $'000 : -, 2021 $'000 : 15,313 : full/partial deferral of principal and interest, 2022 $'000 : 22, 2021 $'000 : 264 : total , 2022 $'000 : 22 , 2021 $'000 : 15,577 table end.
the amortised cost of loans at the date of modification that were considered non-substantial modifications and had loss allowances based on lifetime expected losses was $nil 2021: $267,000 . no gain or loss was recognised as a result of the modification during 2022 and 2021 and the gross carrying amount of loans that have subsequently changed to a 12-month expected loss allowance was $2,054,000 2021: $5,634,000 . the group normally holds collateral against loans and advances to customers.
these are in the form of mortgage interests over property and ownership or other registered interests over assets.
estimates of fair value of collateral are assessed in each accounting period prior to determination of individual impairment allowances.

at the reporting date, there was no significant concentration of credit risk.
debt investments the group and the company held singapore government securities of $191,527,000 as at 31 december 2022 2021: $130,902,000 . the credit rating of singapore government securities held at the reporting date accorded by various international credit rating agencies is aaa 2021: aaa . the group considers that its debt investments have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
hence, the amount of the allowance on debt investments is negligible.
cash and balances with banks the group and the company held cash and balances with banks of $100,260,000 and $100,243,000 respectively as at 31 december 2022 2021: $114,768,000 and $114,751,000 . the cash and balances with banks are mainly held with bank and financial institution counterparties which are rated bbb+ to aa, based on various international credit ratings.
loss allowance on cash and balances with banks has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures.
the group considers that its cash and balances with banks have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
the group uses a similar approach for assessment of ecls for cash and balances with banks to those used for loans and advances.
the amount of the allowance on cash and balances with banks is negligible.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management continued credit risk continued inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment continued statutory deposit with the monetary authority of singapore the group and the company held a statutory deposit with the monetary authority of singapore of $23,445,000 as at 31 december 2022 2021: $24,361,000 , which is rated aaa based on various international credit ratings.
hence, the group considers that its statutory deposits have low credit risk and the amount of allowance is negligible.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
management of liquidity risk the group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group's reputation.
the group is currently funded from equity and deposit liabilities.
liquidity risk arises from the management of the net funding position after accounting for the ongoing cash flows from the loan assets, the deposit liabilities and the interest-bearing placements at various points in time.
liquidity risk is managed in accordance with the group's liquidity framework of policies, contingency funding plan, controls and limits approved by the asset and liability committee 'alco' . this framework ensures that liquidity risk is monitored and managed in a manner that ensures sufficient sources of funds are available over a range of market conditions.
stress testing is conducted under the group/company-specific crisis and general market crisis scenarios.
this is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of the scenarios which may put the group's liquidity at risk.
liquidity risk is also mitigated through the large number of customers in its diverse loans and deposits bases and the close monitoring of exposure to avoid any undue concentration.
maturity analysis of financial liabilities the following are the contractual maturities of the group's and company's non-derivatives financial liabilities, loan commitments and contingent liabilities at the reporting date, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments at the earliest date the group and company can be required to pay.
the expected cash flows on these instruments may vary significantly from this analysis.

\ excludes accrued interest payable notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management continued market risk market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates will affect the group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
the objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that the value of financial assets or liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
the group is not exposed to foreign currency risk.
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the group's financial assets and/or financial liabilities changes because of changes in interest rates.
interest rate risk arises primarily from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities typically reprice at different points in time.
a fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank offered rates ‘ibors’ with alternative nearly risk-free rates referred to as ‘interest rate benchmark reform’ . the group had exposures to swap offer rate ‘sor’ on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives.
in singapore, the steering committee for sor and singapore interbank offered rates ‘sibor’ transition to singapore overnight rate average ‘sora’ together with the association of banks in singapore and singapore foreign exchange market committee, has identified the sora as the alternative interest rate benchmark to replace sibor and sor in singapore.
the timeline for sora to replace sor and sibor is by the end of june 2023 and december 2024 respectively.
as at 31 december 2022, the group’s remaining ibor exposure arises from two syndicated loans that was indexed to sor.
risk management policy the overall objective of interest rate risk management is to manage current and future earnings sensitivity arising from various interest rate exposures.
interest rate risk exposures are measured using a combination of repricing gap, present value of 1 basis point reports and simulation modelling.
the alco recommends policies, ratios and limits for review and concurrence by rmc and approval by the board of directors.
the rmc assists the board in ensuring the effective management of market risks.
the alco meets periodically to review the risk profile of the group against the prevailing business and economic conditions, focusing on market and interest rate risks.
the alco also relates the structure of assets and liabilities to funding mismatches and interest rate repricing risks and ensure compliance with the approved policies and risk exposures including ratios and limits . exposure to interest rate risk the group does not hold a trading portfolio.
the principal risk to which its non-trading portfolio is exposed arises from the risk of fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair values of financial instruments because of changes in market interest rates.
interest rate risk is managed principally through monitoring interest rate gaps and by having pre-approved limits for repricing bands.
the group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the group’s loan and investment portfolios as well as deposit liabilities.
interest rate risk will arise when these assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times or in differing amounts, or when market conditions dictate the extent of repricing possible.
the group manages this risk through diversity in its loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in its deposit portfolio.

excludes prepayments financial risk management continued market risk continued sensitivity analysis interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed under various interest rate scenarios using simulation modelling where the sensitivity of projected net interest income is measured against changes in market interest rates.
the projected impact on future net interest income before tax over the next twelve months from the close of the year is simulated under various interest rate assumptions.
based on a 100 basis point parallel rise in yield curves applied to the reporting date position, net interest income is estimated to increase by $2,675,000 2021: increase by $445,000 . the corresponding impact from a 100 basis point fall is an estimated reduction of $2,674,000 2021: $3,484,000 in net interest income.
the sensitivity analysis of the group is illustrative only.
it assumes that interest rates of all tenors move by the same amount and does not reflect the potential impact on net interest income of some rates changing while others remained unchanged.
the analysis also assumes that all financial assets and liabilities run to contractual maturity without action by the group to mitigate any impact of such changes.
portfolio price risk portfolio price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk , whether caused by factors specific to the individual security or factors that affect all instruments in the market.
at the reporting date, the group has fvoci-debt instruments on singapore government securities of approximately $192 million 2021: $131 million . a 1% increase in prices at the reporting date would have increased equity by $1.9 million 2021: $1.3 million . an equal change in the opposite direction would have decreased equity by $1.9 million 2021: $1.3 million . the analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021. the sensitivity analysis is based on management's best estimate of the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change.
in practice, the actual results will differ from the sensitivity analysis and the differences could be material.
notes to the financial statements year ended 31 december 2022 23 financial risk management continued capital management regulatory capital the group maintains a capital adequacy ratio 'car' in excess of the prescribed ratio, which is expressed as a percentage of adjusted regulatory capital to total risk-weighted assets.
1 the group's adjusted regulatory capital includes share capital, capital reserve, statutory reserve, general reserve, fair value reserve relating to unrealised losses on equity securities classified as fvoci and accumulated profits.

\ excludes prepayments fair values of financial instruments in assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
although management has employed their best judgment in the estimation of fair values, there is inevitably a significant element of subjectivity involved in the calculations.
therefore, the fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the group could have realized in a sales transaction at the reporting date.
the methodologies and assumptions used depend on the terms and risk characteristics of the various instruments and include the following: financial instruments for which fair value approximates the carrying amount the carrying values of statutory deposit with the monetary authority of singapore, other receivables and deposits, cash and balances with banks and trade and other payables, approximate their fair values as these balances are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand.
investment in singapore government securities the fair values of fvoci-debt instruments are determined by reference to their quoted closing bid prices at the reporting date.
loans and advances the fair value of loans and advances that mature or reprice within six months of the reporting date is assumed to equate to the carrying value.
the fair value of all other loans and advances was calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the maturity of the loans.
the discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of loans.
deposits and savings accounts of customers the fair value of deposits and savings accounts of customers which mature or reprice within six months is estimated to be the carrying value at the reporting date.
the fair value of other term deposits was calculated using discounted cash flow models, based on the deposit type and its related maturity.
the discount rates applied in this exercise were based on the current interest rates of similar types of deposits.
borrowings from mas the carrying value of the borrowings from mas approximates its fair values.
