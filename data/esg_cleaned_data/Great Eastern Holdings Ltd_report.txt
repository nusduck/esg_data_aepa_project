. managing our environmental footprint creating positive impact through responsible investing we continue to review our investment strategies and allocate capital to promising areas to foster long-term, sustainable economic growth while improving our portfolios' risk-adjusted returns.
reducing our portfolio carbon intensity climate transition can present a set of unique risks and opportunities to an investment portfolio.
in 2022, we placed close to singapore dollar1bn in asian equities and singapore dollar800mn in asian bond investments with fund managers that are to be managed on a low carbon objective.
we will be transitioning an even greater share of our listed equity and corporate bond asset classes into such strategies over the next five years.
we are assessing the various levers and approaches to decarbonisation, including what a 2050 net zero commitment on our investment portfolio may entail.
we expect to drive a decline in emissions through a combination of low carbon transition mandates and consciously replacing high emitters with lower equivalents.
relating to coal divestments, we have fully exited listed equity exposure in utility companies that do not have a credible transition plan, and materially reduced such exposures within our fixed income portfolio.
we remain committed to fully exit these bond exposures in due course in an orderly manner.
as of december 2022, great eastern group's listed equity portfolio's carbon footprint was 114.0 measures carbon dioxide equivalent across various operational scopes per million singapore dollar invested, 4.5% lower than december 2021 and 16.1% below our december 2020 baseline.
likewise, the portfolio's weighted average carbon intensity of 195.0 measures carbon dioxide equivalent across various operational scopes per million singapore dollar sales represents an improvement of 11.6% from 2020 levels.
the decarbonisation trajectory is not expected to be a linear one, as it is dependent on the pace of transition adopted by global corporates and governments.
we have also observed considerable variability around our emission numbers arising from equity mark-to-market volatility and currency movements, e.grams. malaysian ringgit/singapore dollar input from our regional subsidiaries.
we will be reviewing our carbon measurement methodologies and metrics to ensure that we are in line with industry best practices.
to this end, we engaged an external consultant in 2022 to perform a review of our portfolio carbon footprint calculations for listed equity and corporate bond.
this helps ensure that our procedures are in line with market practices and latest industry standards, and has also informed enhancements to our process.
we are pleased to provide an inaugural update on the carbon footprint of our corporate bond following this review.
as a group, we will look to achieve a 20% reduction in carbon footprint across the listed equity and corporate bond asset classes by 2025 2020 baseline . collectively, these two asset classes represent more than 50% of our assets under management.
these targets demonstrate our commitment and transparency towards decarbonising our portfolios.

notes: listed equity emissions for dec 2020 and 2021 have been restated following a refinement in our carbon methodology and data source inputs.
listed equity emissions are calculated on an equity-share market cap approach, whereas corporate bond emissions are derived based on enterprise value including cash evic attribution.
managing our environmental footprint scaling up green investments beyond taking active steps to reduce emissions across our portfolios, we recognize that as stewards of capital, we can play a significant influence in directing funds towards climate-positive areas.
green bonds, in particular, play a critical role in catalyzing real-world decarbonization.
our holdings in green bonds have doubled from a year ago to c. singapore dollar1.6bn today, and we aim to grow these investments to singapore dollar3bn by 2025. in malaysia, we participated in the inaugural issue of domestic sustainability government bonds via bond forwards.
issuance proceeds would be utilized to finance or refinance eligible social and green projects under malaysia's sustainable development goals sdg sukuk framework.
we have also invested in other areas of sustainable finance impact and decarbonization solutions within private equity.
we plan to commit a certain proportion of new funds to these new areas, and to increase our total commitment to reach singapore dollar100mn by 2025. concurrently, we are exploring opportunities in nature-based solutions, which play an integral role in the climate transition.
enhancing our role as active owners we believe that active stewardship will over time help to steer investee companies towards sustainable business practices, and support the value of our investments.
in 2022, we formalized our stewardship and engagement guidelines and put them into practice.
we will, through our investment affiliate lion global investors lgi and regional investment teams, actively engage the top emitters in our portfolio and those which score poorly on esg characteristics.
in 2022, we conducted close to 300 engagements with companies and raised various topics with them, from the importance of having transition plans to upholding responsible business practices.
exercising our proxy voting rights is a key pillar of our stewardship and engagement program.
we support shareholders' resolutions that promote long-term sustainability of companies in our portfolios, and exercise our votes in such a way that encourages companies to address material esg issues.
together with lgi, in 2022 we voted in support of management 88% of the time while against management 11% of the time.
beyond directly engaging with investee companies, we are now a member of the asia investor group on climate change aigcc with effect from january 2023. we look forward to making joint efforts with other investors in the push towards real-world transition as we play our role as active owners.
ahead of the 27th conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change cop27 , our asset manager lgi signed the 2022 global investor statement to governments on the climate crisis.
along with hundreds of investors around the world, we are calling on governments globally to entrench five priority climate asks into their national legislation.
effective policies that are aligned to the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°c are essential for mobilizing and scaling up private capital flows needed for a climate-resilient, net-zero transition.
beyond these, we have continued our engagements with regulators across the region through regular consultations and participation in surveys.
we participated in industry workgroups for the betterment of practices.
we made contributions in the bank negara malaysia climate change and principle-based taxonomy ccpt implementation group, and provided inputs to the life insurance association lia singapore surveys in preparation for the implementation towards the monetary authority of singapore's mas environmental risk management enrm guidelines.
we maintained partnerships with leading asset managers in the area of sustainability, and joined industry roundtables involving peers in sharing our knowledge of industry practices in the hope of collectively charting the way forward in responsible investments.
promoting low-carbon investments to give investors a simple and cost-effective option to take part in singapore's low-carbon transformation, lgi listed the lion-ocbc securities singapore low carbon etf on the singapore exchange sgx in april 2022. the iedge-ocbc singapore low carbon select 50 capped index is followed by the etf so investors can get diversified exposure to 50 companies in singapore with smaller carbon footprints.
enhancing climate disclosure and mitigation through our insurance portfolio in 2022, we started assessing the environmental risks of our general insurance portfolio based on the united nations principles for sustainable insurance un psi heatmap.
starting with the property line of business in geg, our risk management strategy involves environmental risk identification, assessment and an escalation system according to the risk profile of the customer.
we have also introduced a prohibition on new coal-fired power plants as part of the risk management strategy.
in november 2022, the pcaf launched the global greenhouse gas greenhouse gas accounting and reporting standard for insurance-associated emissions.
the standard supplements are built on the requirements of the greenhouse gas protocol.
we are in the process of assessing our general insurance portfolio in accordance with this standard and will use the net zero insurance alliance target setting protocol to guide our future actions.
