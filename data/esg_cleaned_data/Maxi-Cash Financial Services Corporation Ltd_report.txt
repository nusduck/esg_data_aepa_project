the word "environmental" is prominently displayed in bold, black text to the right of the graphic.
the overall design is clean, simple, and conveys a message related to environmental sustainability.
energy usage and carbon emissions reduction of carbon footprint we recognise that the effective management and monitoring of our carbon footprint can reduce operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholders’ value.
our carbon footprint is measured in terms of greenhouse gas "greenhouse gas" emission.
however, greenhouse gas emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent co₂e is emitted.
our greenhouse gas emission is predominantly indirect scope 2 emission that results from the electricity used.
we have insignificant direct scope 1 emission, and we do not include the greenhouse gas emissions generated by our suppliers scope 3 . considering the changes and dynamics of our business and operations, we have established our greenhouse gas carbon emission index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time.
to this end, we have set a target for greenhouse gas emission efficiency improvement of 23% from our fy2017 level by fy2030.
our target for greenhouse gas emission improvement is 1% per year.
although various business lines and operations account for different percentages of greenhouse gas emissions across the group, they all support and have aligned their environmental objectives accordingly.
in fy2022, our greenhouse gas carbon emission index stands at 3.77. in comparison to our base year fy2017 index at 3.73, it is a 1.1% slightly increase.
for more details on the greenhouse gas carbon emission index, please refer to the section below.

a graphic depicting a cloud with co2 emissions decreasing.
energy usage and co₂ emissions performance table direct and indirect co₂ emissions are measured in total weight of recycled waste, including electronic waste tonnes-co₂ and kilowatt hours kilowatt-hours , from electricity and fuel consumed.
the electricity and fuel that we purchase are both from non-renewable sources.
as our business and operations grow over time, our greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption will vary.
to ensure consistency and comparability of the greenhouse gas emission and electricity consumption measures over time, we have created a greenhouse gas emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance monitoring.
the index adjusts the greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our activities.
we normalize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption by the size of our revenue which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities.
the greenhouse gas emission index is measured in tonnes-co₂ per singapore dollar million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kilowatt-hours per singapore dollar million.
table: greenhouse gas emission and electricity consumption index fy2017-fy2022 year: fy2017, greenhouse gas emission index tonnes-co₂/million singapore dollar : 3.73, electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/million singapore dollar : 7,682 year: fy2019, greenhouse gas emission index tonnes-co₂/million singapore dollar : 3.45, electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/million singapore dollar : 7,141 year: fy2020, greenhouse gas emission index tonnes-co₂/million singapore dollar : 3.29, electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/million singapore dollar : 6,854 year: fy2021, greenhouse gas emission index tonnes-co₂/million singapore dollar : 4.53, electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/million singapore dollar : 9,444 year: fy2022, greenhouse gas emission index tonnes-co₂/million singapore dollar : 3.77, electricity consumption index kilowatt-hours/million singapore dollar : 7,875 table end.
fy2017 was our first year of reporting the performance.
for performance tracking purposes, we will use fy2017 data as our base for our performance tracking towards our fy2030 goals.
as of fy2022, the greenhouse gas emission index stands at 3.77 and the electricity consumption index stands at 7,875, which is 1.1% and 2.5% respectively increase from the base year.
this was mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and electricity consumption by the newly acquired subsidiary during the year.
reduction of paper consumption all our employees are encouraged to minimize paper usage at work by adhering to our paperless initiative.
we encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper consumption.
considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we have established our paper consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time.
due to the successful implementation of our paperless initiative, we have recorded a significant improvement in our paper consumption since fy2018.
hence, we would like to revise our paper consumption improvement target from 23% to 50% by 2030. our target for paper consumption improvement is about 1% per year.
although various business lines and operations account for different percentage of paper consumption across the organization, they have aligned their environmental objectives accordingly.
in fy2022, we consumed a total of 2,547 kilograms of paper.
our paper consumption index stands at 8.5. in comparison to our base year fy2017 index at 14.3, it is a 40.6% improvement.

one ream of paper is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper.
to ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, such as a3 and a4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used, which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of paper.
as our business and operations grow over time, the paper consumption patterns will vary.
we have devised a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring.
the index adjusts the paper consumption for the size of our activities.
we normalize the total weights of paper consumed by the size of our revenue, which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities.
the paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per singapore dollar million.
