  "IFS Capital Limited_report": {
    "rate": "Mostly Not Greenwashing",
    "reason": "IFS's sustainability report demonstrates a relatively strong commitment to sustainability, but some areas warrant further attention.  The report sets clear goals with data supporting progress, and includes short-term action plans.  While they do use some general environmental terms, these are mostly coupled with data and verifiable metrics. The report has been partially audited by EY.  The company addresses several key areas including environmental impact, diversity and inclusion, employee wellbeing, human rights and governance.  However, some aspects of the report show areas for improvement.  Certain data points lack third party verification, some reporting could be more detailed and consistent over time and there's limited disclosure about the impact of the company's supply chain (though a sustainable procurement policy is mentioned).  Overall the report shows more transparency than is usual and actively engages with standards such as the UN Global Compact, GRI and SASB.  Further data transparency and a more fully detailed engagement with industry standards would increase the report's strength and mitigate any impression of greenwashing."
