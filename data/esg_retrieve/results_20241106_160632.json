cyber defence capabilities we enhanced our cyber defence capabilities through the following: enhanced and secured our mobile applications using solutions such as runtime application self-protection rasp , ensuring a continued safe banking experience for customers.the enhanced control detects the presence of malware, prevents unauthorised access on compromised devices, and guides dbs customers to remove malicious mobile applications.implemented secure file transfer technologies to facilitate secure collaboration with external parties, and established secure storage of sensitive data for our developers.reviewed our key cyber security technology stack to identify opportunities for improvement, ensuring alignment with the evolving cyber threat landscape.this led to the refreshment of our: web isolation to enhance our network’s resilience against sophisticated web-borne threats.data protection controls to strengthen overall data protection framework and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.application security testing technologies to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the early stages of the development lifecycle.expanded the implementation of key controls, such as data monitoring and application whitelisting, to further safeguard our critical and key systems.this targeted expansion broadens the protective scope against potential threats, enhances our detection and response capabilities, and ensures the integrity and availability of essential systems.continued investment in machine learning and automation to enable our security operation centre to adequately handle the year-on-year increase in the volume of security events and alerts.our security operation centre monitors cyber-attacks and incidents including data breaches.strengthening cyber incident response in addition to investing in cyber security controls, we equally prioritise the development of robust cyber incident response and recovery capabilities.in 2023, we: implemented deep packet inspection of our web traffic to detect and prevent sophisticated and evasive cyber-attack tactics and techniques.validated more cyber defences and controls against the mitre att&ck framework, simulating the modus operandi of 262 threat actors and 915 cyber-attack techniques.this ensures that our incident response capabilities are aligned with the latest threat intelligence and are adapted to the emerging and ever-changing cyber exploits.continued to expand the scope of our monitoring as we expanded the adoption of public cloud and new cloud technologies, automated the response and investigation of cyber security events and alerts, and enhanced the use cases for our cyber security incident detection and mitigation.validated the efficacy of our incident detection and response capabilities in our adversarial attack simulation exercise where the attack attempts were promptly detected and neutralised.staying vigilant through knowledge sharing and ecosystem partnerships the interconnected nature of cyber threats and their contagion effect necessitates a comprehensive and collective response from the financial industry and the wider ecosystem.collaboration with industry partners, peer banks, regulators, law enforcement, and government agencies is integral to tackling prevailing cyber threats.in view of mobile malware targeting our customers, we participated in an industry effort to share best practices in mobile application security.for example, we implement and operate runtime application self-protection rasp to safeguard our mobile applications against malware.a screenshot of the dbs 5g atm mobile application is shown.enhancing cyber security governance our robust cyber security capabilities and management are underpinned by strong governance and oversight.cyber security is included in the scope of governance of the newly created brmc technology risk committee.additionally, cyber security will attain enhanced independent oversight as part of the technology risk management team's transfer to the risk management group.in response to the cyber security code of practice issued by the cyber security agency of singapore, we have aligned our internal control measures and practices to ensure compliance with the guideline.we enhanced the risk awareness of our technology staff by implementing a targeted technology and cyber risk training curriculum.this was delivered through a combination of online elearning modules and in-person seminars across our six core markets.the training covered a range of technology risk management and cyber security topics.this ensures that technology teams are familiar with the evolving cyber threat landscape, industry technology and cyber security risk management regulatory regimes and the bank's control measures and practices.we further hosted the application security conference which was attended by 875 participants.this platform provided an opportunity to update our developers on key advancements in the areas of software testing and generative ai.cyberwellness programme for the community the dbs cyberwellness programme leverages the bank's expertise to empower employees of social enterprises and charities in the aspect of cyber security awareness.through the comprehensive training provided, participants are equipped with knowledge to identify and effectively respond to cyber threats, thereby contributing to a safer digital environment.since the programme's inception in 2019, we have successfully trained 14,622 participants from charities, social enterprises, smes and institutes of higher learning.delivered through an online platform, participants can access essential security content at their convenience, with 6,421 participants enrolled in 2023.this is a year-on-year increase of 36%.driven by the commitment of our dbs people of purpose volunteers, we have extended this skills-based volunteering initiative to hong kong, with 13 social enterprises signing up for the programme in 2024.the cyberwellness initiative stands as a testament to dbs' commitment to fostering a safer digital environment, thereby making a tangible impact on the community
