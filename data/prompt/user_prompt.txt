**Extract the content from the image and convert it into markdown format with the following guidelines:**

1. **Textual Content**:
   - Extract all **headings** and **text** from the image. Use bold formatting for section titles (e.g., **Section Title**) and plain text for descriptions or paragraphs.
   - For any **lists or bullet points**, format them as markdown bullet points or numbered lists as appropriate. Ensure that all key details (e.g., statistics, amounts, and names) are preserved accurately.

2. **Tables and Charts**:
   - **Charts**: If the image contains a chart, extract all available numerical data and organize it in a simplified table. Avoid trying to replicate any chart formatting that might lead to inconsistencies or loss of clarity.
     - If a chart represents multiple dimensions (e.g., different years, categories, and variables), treat each dimension as a separate column and ensure the data is clearly aligned.
     - Clearly label each data type to avoid confusion.
     - Merge data where necessary into separate columns.
     - If a label has additional sub-labels, consolidate them into a single header to ensure consistency across columns.
   - **Tables**: Ensure that all tables are cleanly extracted:
     - Use correct markdown table syntax for headers and rows.
     - **Handing Table Irregularities**:
        - If there is an irregularity in the table structure (e.g., some rows have more cells than headers or complex multi-level headers), simplify the headers so that they align clearly with the table data, and ensure that all key information is preserved.
        - Adjust multi-level headers into a single row for clarity. For example, merge separate header rows or categories into a single line when possible.
     - **Bold the table title** before the table using this format: **Table: [Table Name]**.
     - If no table title exists, create a concise and descriptive summary as the title.
     - Identify key variables or categories (e.g., year, region, value types, percentages) and use them as headers in the table.
     - Make sure to capture all numerical data, percentages, or other units in the correct columns.
     - Avoid column shifting issues by making sure that all columns are clearly separated and data remains within the corresponding columns.
     - Ensure the table is clean, aligned, and easy to read.

3. **Image Handling**:
   - For any images other than charts (e.g., logos or photos), replace them with markdown placeholders like ![Image Description](). 
   - If there are **captions** or relevant text descriptions for the images, extract and place them before or after the image placeholders.

4. **Formatting**:
   - Ensure the markdown content is structured logically, with clear section breaks and headings.
   - Retain any special formatting such as **bold text** or *italic text* as presented in the image.

5. **Notes and Footnotes**:
   - If the image contains **footnotes** or additional context, include them at the end of the markdown document in plain text format.

6. **Output Format**:
   - Use plain markdown formatting for all content.
   - Use $ $ for block formulas and inline formulas where applicable. Don not use ```markdown ``` or ``` ``` to wrap the content.
