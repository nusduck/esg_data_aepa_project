## Annotation Guidelines

1. **Focus on 2022 Data**: Only annotate data related to the year 2022. Information from other years should be labeled as O.
2. **Value Annotations**: Only numerical values and their units need to be annotated with B-VALUE, I-VALUE, B-UNIT, and I-UNIT.
3. **Frameworks and Disclosure Practices**: It might include sdgs, tcfd, gri, sgx that's what you should only annotate.
4. **Token-Level Annotation**: Each word (token) in the sentence should be annotated individually.
5. **Proper Tokenization**: Ensure that the sentence is properly tokenized before annotation. Use spaces, punctuation, and appropriate tokenizers for English.

## Example Annotation

Let’s walk through an example sentence to demonstrate the BIO tagging process.

### Example Sentence

In 2022, the company reported a total energy consumption of 5,000 MWh and emitted 1,200 metric tons of CO2.

### Step 1: Tokenization

First, split the sentence into tokens (words and punctuation marks):

| **Token**   | **Description**                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| In          | Preposition                       |
| 2022        | Year (specific data to annotate)  |
| ,           | Comma                             |
| the         | Determiner                        |
| company     | Noun                              |
| reported    | Verb                              |
| a           | Determiner                        |
| total       | Descriptor for energy consumption |
| energy      | Noun (part of Energy Consumption) |
| consumption | Noun (part of Energy Consumption) |
| of          | Preposition                       |
| 5,000       | Numerical value to annotate       |
| MWh         | Unit to annotate                  |
| and         | Conjunction                       |
| emitted     | Verb                              |
| 1,200       | Numerical value to annotate       |
| metric      | Descriptor for unit               |
| tons        | Unit to annotate                  |
| of          | Preposition                       |
| CO2         | Unit to annotate                  |
| .           | Period                            |

### Step 2: Assign BIO Labels

Based on the tagging scheme, assign labels to each token. We’ll focus on annotating the numerical values and their units related to the ESG metrics for 2022.

| **Token**   | **Label**     | **Explanation**                          |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| In          | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| 2022        | O             | Year reference (focus is on 2022 data)   |
| ,           | O             | Punctuation                              |
| the         | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| company     | O             | Outside any entity                       |

| a           | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| total       | B-ENV_ENC_TEC | Beginning of Total Energy Consumption    |
| energy      | I-ENV_ENC_TEC | Inside Total Energy Consumption          |
| consumption | I-ENV_ENC_TEC | Inside Total Energy Consumption          |
| of          | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| 5,000       | B-VALUE       | Beginning of a numerical value           |
| MWh         | B-UNIT        | Beginning of unit (Megawatt-hour)        |
| and         | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| emitted     | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| 1,200       | O             | Beginning of a numerical value           |
| metric      | O             | Descriptor (not part of unit annotation) |
| tons        | O             | Beginning of unit (tons)                 |
| of          | O             | Outside any entity                       |
| CO2         | O             | Beginning of unit (CO2)                  |
| .           | O             | Punctuation                              |

**Notes:**

- **Total Energy Consumption**: The phrase “total energy consumption” is part of the Environmental category (ENV_ENC_TEC).
  - **total**: B-ENV_ENC_TEC
  - **energy** and **consumption**: I-ENV_ENC_TEC
- **Values and Units**:
  - **5,000**: B-VALUE
  - **MWh**: B-UNIT (since it’s a single token, only B-UNIT is needed)
